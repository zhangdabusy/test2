In a variety of places , especially in West Africa , migration has been established as &quot; <unk> &quot; it .
There is a lot of migration to find migration as ordinary as migration in neighbouring countries , the most common type of migration , especially in West Africa - or whether there is a huge distance to the migration , especially in West Africa .
Europe is not always the target of migration .
Sicilian writes :
These travel is often a particular place .
You can download half half of a place for a time to work and earn money .
After then , you will continue to continue and maybe another place for some time .
Or you will be deported from the country to be deported .
The whole thing is a lot and <unk> as the <unk> way to Europe as he is often represented .
Without jobs and opportunities in their <unk> , it will be as the <unk> decision to leave home and make better ways .
Just as a young person &apos;s decision , a decision to take advantage of dignity .
The young people is often expected to be <unk> for their parents and other family members , &quot; says Onyando .
Judge agrees : &quot; It &apos;s about to improve the situation at home .
Among the young people in Mali have deep inspiration towards his country .
There is a basic critic of mistrust that the political system will help . &quot;
For the young people , which can be expected by them , and they can take their clan as adults , they hope outside their country .
As long as the situation in their homeland will not change , young people will take on the way to other places .
&quot; It will be OK , &quot; he says ?
In the words , &quot; It will be OK &quot; for the young Guineans in their country .
But who can be the guarantee that the situation will be OK ?
Like many other campaigns in the EU , the video makes the accent solely solely solely on the migration threats and mentioned opportunities that young people in their home are not explicitly <unk> .
Of course , the opinion is : &quot; If they want to preserve the message home , they would have to show some of the opportunities that are there there . &quot;

The passport by Miguel Wilkinson is known as his life .
&quot; The passport is in fact .
It is my name , my <unk> and <unk> , &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old , &quot; said the 22 @-@ year @-@ old voice , points out the document .
&quot; I don &apos;t want it .
He is not red as the passports of all other and the word doesn &apos;t want to sell .
I am not a or there else . &quot;
With its identification ID , Miguel varieties of identification can travel , but they don &apos;t want to know his nationality .
Stay wait for Miguel in the last stage in the trial to end the full smart nationality .
For example , <unk> is one of the most obvious people who have been reported after the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in Georgia , but there are no nationality .
They are only one of the most accomplished 10 million eligible countries across the world , but the consequences are not less <unk> .
&quot; Without you , you &apos;re a non @-@ citizens , &quot; explained Zhelezniak , the principal representative of the UNHCR in Georgia .
&quot; This means you don &apos;t have access to health and education .
You can &apos;t vote , no one can go to the bench , you can &apos;t go to marry or car . &quot;
It also means that there is no right to a formal funeral or a <unk> .
Miguel had not been <unk> until 2015 .
20 , he received the status status of his status .
Oddly , not knowing when he couldn &apos;t exist in the window of the law .
He was born as a son of an Nigerian father and a mother in Tbilisi &apos;s 13 @-@ Armenian mother , until age , after age three years old , he had a Russian passport .
When his mother visited Tbilisi &apos;s family in Tbilisi , she said her passport was allegedly .
He did not want his grandchildren to be Russian oppositionist , told him .
This should be reversed as a result of the decision .
Initially , with his mother , sitting with his mother .
But after a <unk> , they had to <unk> , <unk> .
While he <unk> his memories , he leaves the sight from his hands and let &apos;s leave each other .
He learned that it can be dangerous .
&quot; I just remember that my mother and I started to sleep on the street , &quot; he says , &quot; when I was 11 years old .
I didn &apos;t go to school .
I immediately came out everywhere . &quot;
Documentation films were apparently missing .
A 22 @-@ year @-@ old Miguel faction was born in Moscow , when he moved his mother to Tbilisi .
His father - allegedly a Nigerian <unk> - disappeared before a long time ago .
A fresh encounter with a people who loved as a lawyer for the UNHCR to end the full @-@ estate program brought him back in the circles of interior .
His case has been issued by state officials of the Ministry of Justice and a year later , received a identification officer as a <unk> .
This cable gives the same rights as any other citizens leave the right to vote and the right to work in public service .
Right now , he lives in a dormitory for homeless in Tbilisi and waiting for the anticipated decision of his nationality in 1910 .
However , the respectable passport is a lot more than just a document .
&quot; You see in my face that I &apos;m different , &quot; he says , &quot; he says , &quot; he says .
&quot; I speak of <unk> , but not like a camp .
I speak there , but I don &apos;t see an Armenians .
I speak Russian , but also not like an Russian .
It &apos;s all that I need to be a need to heal the wound of the non @-@ cooler . &quot;
Without documents , it is difficult for the <unk> Miguel incredibly .
In 2017 , he was working as a security camp in a room where devices can be free to use it .
He is not the only one with this wish .
According to the dissolution of the Soviet Union collapse , the border between the different states were set up as a result of millions of people in a row .
By adequate obstacles , the territorial conflict or very simple because documents from a recent era were no more <unk> , they were to &quot; strangers . &quot;
In Georgia , thousands of people live by separatist conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia countries , Georgia tries to have a sense of belonging to a sense of belonging .
Two years on the street with his mother , Miguel slab was taken in Tbilisi &apos;s street <unk> in Tbilisi .
He shares a room with two other people .
This is how Georgia signed a United Nations Convention on the Convention for fundamental rights and protection of basic rights .
Since then , the UNHCR has found the exact number of <unk> , the process of the government &apos;s reputation of citizenship and health workers were trained in their identification centers in the <unk> centers .
The number of people have been receiving undocumented citizenship in the past three years , according to official figures , according to official figures , the number of people in Georgia has been about 49 percent .
Eventually , a &quot; dire problem &quot; is a &quot; dire problem , &quot; says UNHCR workers .
&quot; Politics must have the will to solve this problem . &quot;
However , as a result , domestic knowledge among members of ethnic minorities and in rural communities have one of the largest obstacles .
&quot; Education is very low , &quot; says Osnat Gillor , the founder of the Environmental and Fi Centre , a non @-@ profit organization in Tbilisi who promotes access to state businesses .
&quot; The people aren &apos;t able to understand that the effects of the leaks can &quot; have no comment on them in the park . &quot;
Science lives in a small neighborhood outside Tbilisi , and runs a own <unk> on the market .
It was only that they had no correct documents when they have no correct documents .
The 59 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> is such a human being .
She was born in Grozny in Grozny that is born in today &apos;s Russia , which was 1980 , in which she went to Georgia to work there .
The only document she needed then was its Soviet <unk> because it &quot; haven &apos;t been borders . &quot;
In the 1990s , she moved to Tbilisi , but today &quot; Don &apos;t go anywhere anywhere from her &quot; &quot; says lawyer , &quot; says lawyer , referring to <unk> and children .
At the end of 2016 , when a hospital was asked after her identification , declaring that her Soviet passport and her only <unk> was away .
She searched her passport , but she couldn &apos;t find her passport .
Thirty @-@ Leste &apos;s case was posted on the public registry of the UNHCR , along with UNHCR and the Georgian Institute of Community Research and Roberto Centre , seeking to determine their legal status .
No red means no health .
Even though <unk> Soviet passport is no longer <unk> , &quot; it would be possible to clarify that their legal status , &quot; says Mejia .
&quot; There are no information about them in the contest , no information . &quot;
Through research in the underground and interviews with family @-@ related family and other people , they are now trying to prove their right to <unk> their identification cards for several months .
From war in a <unk>
Violeta Camarasa ( 49 ) left her village village in Abkhazia , in 1992 of the war between Tbilisi &apos;s war between Tbilisi .
She then did not arrive until they don &apos;t return .
For a long time , the goal is to get citizenship .
In the case of 49 @-@ year @-@ old Tea , 2004 , the two years was the two years .
tribe is ethnically ethnically ethnic and left her home home in 1992 for the beginning of a day in 1992 after she was carrying her allegiance to the <unk> of Georgian government .
Violeta Camarasa , here with her Spanish @-@ language lover of Life , received a child living in 2014 .
She lives in a suburb of Tbilisi today .
She knows exactly when she was non @-@ citizen , it was shortly after the general parliamentary elections in Georgia .
&quot; I forget my bag with my documents in a taxi .
There was a big chaos .
I never found the driver . &quot;
At the same time , <unk> is a <unk> on the market in Tbilisi , and they tried to receive a official identification ID in Tbilisi .
With her post @-@ <unk> heritage , she says , she &apos;s going back to the world of a migrant boy .
For hundreds of other people , this goes on .
Two childhoods is full of the only largest people .
The 49 @-@ year @-@ old has heard nothing from her family since she left her hometown of Abkhazia since September 1992 .

The company explained clearly that LGBT content would be directly affected , and there were already deleted stories from the subject of registering a total of 62 <unk> , apples , and <unk> .
The next day , &quot; LGBT minorities &quot; published a popular LGBT flag , a popular LGBT flag , a popular LGBT media statement :
Due to circumstances , outside of our control , the editorial @-@ based work of LGBT troops appeared on Weibo .
During this time , we will not be using the official Weibo account of LGBT propaganda .

All that should be transformed into history .
With you to our side , the LGBT community is strong .
We will continue to be healthy , scientific and physical LGBT content so that the public can be a inclusive and understanding of our community .
This is the best way to offer discrimination .
LGBT rights advocates will remain diplomatic and the Chinese LGBT community is ready to serve .
However , this is only a barrier that has been evicted from the way .
The SouthAfrica WorldCupBlog was not an isolated case , nor it was a quick mistake of the company .
It was led by confidential pressure .
LGBT content has been on the focus of <unk> in recent years .

At the same time , the German government &apos;s commitment to be able to do will be able to do anything more likely to speak more of the public domain , but it does not mean that LGBT content will stay in the next <unk> .

It is not surprising that Erdogan &apos;s clumsy <unk> is difficult to find it difficult to find a electorate at almost 60 million cast views , including about 1.5 million new voters .
Erdogan then denies that the generous coverage of the generous reporting that has received its campaign from national television and other pro @-@ government mass media .
&quot; Give me a example .
Where and what the campaign has blocked a state of emergency ? &quot; he asked this week in his hometown of Letpadan in the Black Sea of Turkey .
He also pointed out that the state of emergency could be avoided .
It is also recognized that the most important president , president of Erdogan &apos;s election .

The Joint Prevention Prevention Center ( e.g. : soy infections ) organized this campaign already in his third year .
The Japanese word &quot; <unk> &quot; will be used as well as the public domain as well .
The francophones contain different messages that readers would point out that a crime is a crime and that doesn &apos;t let this happen .
With wearing the &quot; <unk> guy &quot; <unk> , girls show how much they hate .
In order to understand that this is necessary to determine that they should stop sexual harassment and attacks .
In fact , women who drive up with the train , are often very often .
According to Japan Times :
The figures of the survey suggests that merit cases of domestic abuse or harassment were reported in 2017 , 30 per cent of domestic deaths between 7 and 9 am at the Sultanate .
Over 50 percent of the cases continue in trains , according to the report , and another 20 percent of Delhi .
In the same time , there were reports that nearly 30 percent of the respondents are the girls .
Ancient media applicants are being treated by the police according to Section Report of Penal Code .
It is also reported that it is difficult to continue such cases .
Although the police and the more active campaigns to stop the <unk> in trains , these embassies are most likely to stop the women who are able to stop themselves from the start of the world .
Comments on the comments is often trying to determine what such behavior and media is very critical about how men can speak out of false accusations on the ground .

Sexual harassment is a crime !
Activist Noriko Rakotoarison , who represents the <unk> Center of Environmental Center ( about neurotoxic crowdfunded activities ) , says that the idea of the teacher &apos;s teacher was the first time of a student and her mother , a friend of <unk> .
In her first year in college , the girl was sitting at a day when the school was harassed and beaten by school workers :
&quot; The perpetrators didn &apos;t have a sign of <unk> . &quot; This doesn &apos;t want to live again , &quot; she decided .
And they created a map where reads :
&quot; I don &apos;t do it anymore !
Sexual harassment are a crime ! ! &quot;
Then the girl took this map to their <unk> and walked with the school .
She was never tired .
Soweyda reported that the girl &apos;s campaign had been made on social media in 2015 , and it was the idea of the idea with the <unk> .

This post was collected in November with a crowdfunding project ( <unk> ) in November with a crowdfunding project and had 2.12 million JPY ( $ euro ) .
To ensure that the young women would take this design , &quot; she collected recommended design ideas from encouraging people to take part in the event .
In January , 2013 , Gandhi was also launched in front of the informal Autonomous Center ( ICG to prevent sexual harassment ) to prevent awareness about this issue .
The idea of this anti @-@ campaign campaign is that the girls can raise awareness about the harassment and that the society is not <unk> :
The concept of this <unk> :
:
- None of the <unk> <unk> will be
- No one will be a <unk>
- No one seems to be accused of <unk>

While the most citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have seen the <unk> of Greece with Greece as a serious issue , some are using humor and satire .
Greece has long been struggling to have a name called for a name that has been exposed to <unk> the neighbouring Greek region and the ancient Greek kingdom .
Thus , it is important to ensure that Greece will be blocked to the European Union of European Union ( EU ) and NATO ( NATO ) , as long as the name is not allowed to be changed to the Greek scene of Greece .
This has led to some levels of xenophobia in two countries .
Most of the residents of the <unk> see the blockade as a <unk> form of terrorism while many Greeks believe their northern neighbors are going to throw a wish for ride .
The nationalists of both countries have expressed their feelings of humiliation and frustration , creating the problem and draw attention to political praise for &quot; patriotism &quot; .

Sequence from a picture shared on social media .
Since April 18 , 2018 , the chaos and rights of protesters and the media are directly threatened .
As protesters , who were demanding more social security and government accountability , have been attacked by the police , the military and other members of the government , were attacked and their equipment were attacked and their source were stolen .

In the midst of protests against social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , state control has reached control of new measures .
In June 2018 , Venezuelans have had to appear to appear to seem to recognize the Venezuelans &apos; highest measure , and the latest measure is the most important measure to limit access to public populations .
The path was long and counting .
As of the late president of the late president Hugo Chávez and TV , President Nicolás Maduro started to radio and TV , with President Nicolás Maduro , who has been led by President Nicolás Maduro in a business model where the state has moved to the state or <unk> influence on their belts and commercial activities .
Moreover , the National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) - the ANC &apos;s National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) - which was carried out earlier at the depths of the National Constituent Assembly , was a controversial law that was organized by social media , and is a controversial video that is called &quot; hate &quot; or away .
You have already been able to determine that people have been arrested because of tweets , it seems that it has been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has been causing a huge shortage of goods and basic services such as paper , electricity , and <unk> .
The shortage of political access to information and news has access to information and news has a tense level of communication and spreading information .
Newspapers go online ... and will then be blocked
With the low rise rise in food prices , local newspapers were forced to stop their expenses , but local newspapers have been forced to stop their expenses or free online to stop their expenses , without guarantee their readers .
At the beginning of 2018 , a journalist tweeted :
The Bangladesh edition of El weblogs is reported to be blocked in various locations .
I watched today that my computer access to El weblogs , La Propaladora and other Venezuelan pages that are &quot; unpleasant &quot; for the dictatorship .
Does others have the problem ?
This can be a result of a police report .
Months later , in early June , journalists on Twitter and other media outlets reported that El Forum was blocked , one of the most important newspapers in the country :
It &apos;s a El app on the server <unk> : <unk> <unk>
&quot; It &apos;s not about shepherding , it &apos;s going &quot;
Kaghz Público , a organization that defended free expression and access to information , condemned on their Twitter account that telecommunications service platforms , blocking online content , using online content and communication services .
The measure is taking advantage of the public and the media inside both and abroad .
K.R. Arouri explains what clearly made the impression of morality and decency :
The question of being raised here is how it could come to this point .
Each thing would say that Chavism is a regime that has already become a regime that has already followed the society .
Those who try to push him into the way will be reached by a full rule of society .
Other users began quick to analyze the real reach of the measure and their close ties with online censorship - one of Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main problem is not only the block of pornographic websites , which is so far , but that the ban will also spread on other sites .
What does they use blocking of porn sites ?
They obliged the blocking of other pages to be the next one .
However , other users suggest that there is no case for censorship .
They crossed broadband Internet and the government &apos;s control of the issue :
The blocking of porn sites is neither absent , nor it has been created because the government wants to protect children .
The reason for Venezuela is that Venezuela has no money to pay the scope of these pages that will require them to comply with Internet access .
What kinds of alternatives is there ?
Perhaps Tor can help ... or not not .
Tor is a free software , which is used to be used to be anonymous , and it allows it to use the internet as well as Tor .
The ban on Tor &apos;s network network seems to block Tor , and therefore not entirely effective .
Still , organizations like Acceso Libre or Ssuuna Sin confirms that Tor was blocked .
They beat solutions to end these restrictions :
We can confirm that Tor ( in direct link ) is blocked @ <unk> , you can use it with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
The website is reported on blocking of the Twitter user @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To bypass censorship , using bridges , use bridges and Tor :
If you look at the context and history , the projection of freedom of expression and access to information .
Many Venezuelans are asking for what media or <unk> are being done as the next , and what will be done to be <unk> .

Are it consistent and highly effective reports before the order to determine the highway ?
There are regulations to control the problem .

Amnesia .
I am a staunch supporter of the <unk> ; which is far from learning to learn and gather new experiences .
This belief is both the subject of both human beings and intellectual .
So when the opportunity for a temporary scale of a temporary unlicensed non @-@ profit organization ( French NGO ) , I packed my suitcase and made me to Europe .
I wasn &apos;t about the big money made of us , it would be expected , although the salary was expected .
The thing is that no one prepared one is prepared , and it is rare to be written in a institution that is led by a white majority .
He was born in Uganda and mainly in the African region of the Great lakes I had no real idea what would mean .
Even though I was familiar with the <unk> in Africa , a network of the Democratic Republic of Congo , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo , was published in his movie &quot; Kangpe - On the other hand , I had to show the experience , a minority , not made .
Since the revelations of Oxfam in Haiti , international NGO workers have been responsible for sex women for sex paid for sex paid in recent months .
Following the related riots and resulted in a number of other media leaders in international media outlets , Angela Bruce @-@ Taweel , who has found major attention in the media , has been one of the most <unk> <unk> for humanitarian aid in Haiti on 8 America .
Her article &quot; But <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; But wait until they see your black face &quot; ) where they see inclusion and racism , left a deep impression on me .
In addition to the comments of other black women from the sector , the <unk> of social exclusion and social marginalization , where you need to leave it , were completely familiar .
I had an international organizations to explore different marketing organizations , and that the need for the local population to be represented in these organizations .
I had already been talking about the cartoons of ordinary people , as they draw the media .
This new opportunity offered me to create one of the most important challenges in countries in the world - stable migration .
But neither my training in gender questions and <unk> my experiences during a short couple of minutes , and he was able to prepare myself to see this scenario .
Later , I learned that I came to a time where I was demanding a time .
My interrogators sparkle with me and calls for recognition for a national African woman in the team .
A few months later , two weekly staff from Kenya and South Sudan were in the press service that had exclusively been white .
One day , our <unk> was the only one of the only African football team in the <unk> , and called for three African employees .
Perhaps it was the normal way , with the employees in this organization , which was surely the first signs of things that don &apos;t make things <unk> .
Then we exchanged a hilarious smile with the managers and our work back .
This was the first time I was <unk> outside of my skin colour .
By this day , no one of the seniors editors have not been forgotten .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> took me to my <unk> .
I was crying because this African woman escape the war , and their mental health and its clear sense of essentials was required to extend their skills , and all this is only to meet one man like this .
I was crying because I was not complaining about my own , my African colleague , and was convinced it was my duty to protect them from such a <unk> .
The editor &apos;s editor was a white Europeans that had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was &quot; very recommended &quot; to cover the experiences of migrants , and you know what the group is about , &quot; poor Africans , &quot; like I heard about several occasions .
For these men , we were utterly African leaders , not people with communicating with their job .
In order to become a whole of the world , the <unk> situation was with the only white woman in the team .
Because of all that , the woman was working at meetings at meetings .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should participate in a particular meeting I did not know that it was a video that was a lot of work on my desk .
Within 30 minutes , the supervisor was at my door and demanded that I was going to the meeting , and made sure that I didn &apos;t really disagree .
I was surrounded by privileges the White Helmets .
The role that was buried in the racist and <unk> environment was just clear .
She was the one who decided if a contract was achieved , how my co @-@ worker was found on the hard tour .
I can &apos;t count , how often I got calls for ourselves and got a true mine of abuse to me because a single thing was not brought to the table .
And <unk> , when someone made my commitment to <unk> my efforts .
Vaccination <unk> were <unk> .
The supervisor expressed his hostility of female female mutilation - all of whom were - and doesn &apos;t know - and wasn &apos;t even <unk> remarks about these women .
Although most of the students of the Middle East Timor @-@ Leste knew that this man had never been chance to address the topic .
As the work itself was interesting , and I had learnt a price I had to pay a price , I had to pay for ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract at another department but my government demanded that I stayed headed .
The fact that I had had a contract without his release , drove him to his worst behaviour .
I shared a office with another white <unk> who raised all his calls to bypass TV , who started calling for me to express me and make me with all sorts of <unk> .
I learned of others that the plan gave me to <unk> , which I also had to see .
But I had a digital system from the Nothing .
I managed to build workshops with employees in <unk> relationships , even though they used to attend the death of the protest session .
I didn &apos;t all that , as long as I was not aware of the superiors , it was not grateful .
The evident harassment and <unk> led that two colleagues had their job ; a guest in a different department and the other was denied a <unk> , because he was the White Cross of the office .
We tried trying to report these racism and sexism .
Twenty @-@ year @-@ old colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something because &quot; he has good links to the Big Stadium in the <unk> . &quot;
Again , learning was too pointless .
A recent member of the state @-@ based colleague assured me that it would be a consultant to report the events because I would risk a bad motive .
In spite of all of these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave the organization , instead of appropriate employment and justice .
But <unk> , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 percent of all workers in a sector where women are the ones who are affected , and I hope that discussions on # <unk> to promote the scale of racism and abuse in the aid of development aid in development development .
Those responsible need to find solutions for inclusion - not only in the sense , to ensure that there are real guidelines , participatory practices , and opportunities to prevent such acts of violence .

In June 2018 , the Wildlife Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the southern town of June 2018 , where the &apos; jungle of Calais &quot; was home to 10,000 refugees from Afghanistan , Sudan , Syria , Eritrea , Iraq , Iraq and other countries .
With clashes and a intense media coverage , the refugee camp has been destroyed in October 2016 and the ground in October 2016 .
The local authorities decided to make this place to a <unk> , and <unk> it as a &quot; ecological and hygienic object &quot; in the form of a &quot; beautiful flame &quot; on the official website , is growing by a &quot; beautiful flame such as about dogs and the presence of birds , such as <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
However , there are however , however , that the idea of this project is to remove undesirable people from the city , and no damage to protect the territory and fauna .
Benin is nothing more than <unk>
Since the &quot; jungle &quot; shook last year , the French authorities have also been similar projects in other parts of Calais .
According to another <unk> , a small forest cover , which is a community of emergency <unk> , <unk> a park in a park , becoming the effort that forests are increasingly accessible , while parks will be inaccessible .
The official name of the 2.5 hectares of the 2.5 hectares is the &quot; Leme Mendes . &quot;
Every day they will get local organisations with food , water and water supplies .
The forest cover is located between a freeway , a <unk> and a residential area .
This caused the past to other local communities in the past and again , especially in the context of support for refugees , according to Help , local authorities do not pay enough assistance to the refugees .
Mayor Nuno Himmelreich presented a role in the municipal front center on June 12 , 2018 , in front of the municipal front center .
Global Voices participated in the gathering .
However , in this forest @-@ based man , however , we received almost 15 minutes after years ago , when another local leader must be careful to find a solution .
The city &apos;s plans to see that the park is being limited to the park , from a space that is limited to prevent a stop outside of the park , and to prevent cameras to stop the national flag .
According to the Mayor , which aims to identify the owner of dogs who <unk> their business in the park .
In the gathering , numerous other proposals were presented , including the construction of <unk> , a <unk> or <unk> @-@ <unk> .
toilets and <unk> were not mentioned .
The cost of emergency will be paid for the city to 1.5 million euros .
The project is surprising that some elements of major priority are a certain priority as others were planned for August 2018 .

In terms of the new strategy , &quot; no compass &quot; will be used by authorities , using fire , tear gas or tents , tear gas , and blankets .
These actions are usually <unk> at night or dawn , without warning and under a great <unk> .
The refugees are not only taken their housing properly , but also their personal possessions are confiscated , including many cases of police brutality against refugees , including minors .
We will never know what clever Mendes was named after the <unk> of the <unk> , to say that .
In 1988 , Thailand &apos;s Brazilian activist dedicated to his life to fight the struggle for the Amazon forest and the rights of the migrants and indigenous farmers .
With the words of Michel Lyazidi , director of the French National Research Center for Development ( &quot; The jungles of Calais &quot; ) , the <unk> is just a attempt to destroy the past that the &quot; holiday &quot; of the city is just a attempt to dispose of the &quot; holiday of a city &quot; to kill the past .
Many political crises are currently facing many people to see .
The residents of Calais are outraged by the fact that they are treated so bad and the bad picture that is being taught by her city .
It is not exactly about the camp or the migrants , but rather about that there is no solution to the plight of these people .

Rape Rape Toll in the camps · Global Voices
More than two decades of civil war and famine forced many people to live in Somalia , leaving the homes of returning to homes .
Women and girls living outside of the major cities are mostly affected by sexual assault .
They are vulnerable , and most of rape cases are in the middle or when they collect blockades in remote places .
However , due to the law enforcement , victims are often unable to conduct legal counsel , but it would be necessary to make justice for them .
Homesickhome , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old mother and neighborhood of the Formosa Foundation &apos; camp , was raped by the eyes of her children , who raped her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , they described the attack :
It was midnight when a armed man in a <unk> <unk> in a semi @-@ <unk> <unk> in my apartment was forcibly pulled off outside of the sea .
He did not only bother me , but he was also <unk> me with a heavy wound on my body , which is still a lot of pain .
On the night of the evening , men of the suicide police fired men from the semi @-@ police camp in the compound of Sousse , located in the central city of Maracay .
The men burn fire and twisted some other families .
Both women were raped and must wait for justice for their forced injuries .
However , the attackers were arrested , however , they were charged with a court charged with their crimes .
According to the Human Rights Right Centre , an independent state @-@ based local community in the region , were reported in 2017 .
However , the actual number of rape cases are higher , however , because many victims of the victims don &apos;t file a complaint - afraid of stigma to the lack of crimes and lack of resources .
Apart from the lack of legal health issues , the health system and lack of effective equipment and medical equipment and medical equipment who needed to be needed in this sector is needed to be required .
The public health is not allowed to deal with rape cases .
Domestic culture also cannot be able to accept justice as a economic custom that victims are able to accept or &quot; Camels or livestock &quot; as compensation for the attack :
Rape are ubiquitous and remains in much of frequent locations , as a decades of conflict in a decades of violence and committed institutions to pass the law .
The tradition states that rape victims are an compensation - often camels or animals - accept their attackers as part of a special threat to end the war between rival tribes .
Little steps in the right direction - but it &apos;s enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 , the disputed region ignited the opening of the first analysis of the first analysis of estimates that involves rape cases .
A year earlier , in September 2016 , an anti @-@ corruption law was passed in the country &apos;s first disputed region , which has passed its full support to the bill by 42 members of the bill , which later has officially been officially revoked on a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the federal state of the state @-@ backed state , which also suggested the country &apos;s constitution , also proposed a new anti @-@ corruption bill .
However , it is still a long time until this bill , the second House of the parliament , decided to be passed from the parliament &apos;s second house , decided to be passed and recognized as law .
Although the problem of rape rape has been covered in the past few years and the international community , both sexual violence remains widespread against women and children , and the number of attacks are rising .

The analysis of the Moroccan committee &apos;s analysis of anonymity is also a common majority against legalizing .

My head and my body was still absent .
I felt still the same fear as I take care of the help and distress of medical professionals and the doctors I had had to be given to the creation of the term .
When I was sleeping , I had to be a record of Dr. N. and Dr. B. I have to be looking for Dr. Salvador , especially after I saw him in Congress .
She concludes :
I feel that I have a lot of condemnation in the past few days .
I have a couple of friends who <unk> me as if they keep my hands , I am just one of the many women with a green scarf who looks at the Congress and asks him to vote for the decriminalization .
On Twitter , users have responded to political issues and diverse opinions to favor the bill :

They will be every single woman who have <unk> on the conscience .
Abortion is being held , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just involved in rape for legal abortion , if not , they have the <unk> that they were doing , &quot; he says .
Targeted or illegal abortion , this is the question .
If the draft bill is adopted , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America that is the global trend to legalize or sovereignty .
The first country in the region that made this step , was Uruguay &apos;s 2012 .
At the end of the day , the outlook for the South American state in Latin America seemed to be found .

The days are hard , nights of nights .
And the darkness only only .
Even if you are not tortured , it is not being tortured .
Do they forget us ?
Are we doing the rest of our life here ?
Why did we not sleep today ?
Did they see the phone ?
Questions about questions that you talk about the head .
The day continues .
All days are equal - the stench of blood and <unk> , which <unk> around you all .
You remember each other about the bodies of the other detainees and at the unforgiving walls .
How kind of it feels like it .
The fifth day , until the evening , will be viewed as usual .
The guards opens the door and calls for : &quot; Sarmad , dressing ! &quot; I leave the cell and <unk> my arms face so they could go through the head and lay .
I am <unk> to a space that looks like previous as previous as previous .
&quot; On the knees , I follow the order to leave the order .
The most fascinating conversation will be accompanied by the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> on paper ; another person is now in the room .
You really see very well , more than older than your age , and if you are actually the son of a medical doctor you can only get out of a good home .
Why do you get a gun with you ? &quot;
He starts with a lawsuit for non @-@ authorized detention center in front of the hope that I have at least participated in demonstrations . &quot;
I never had one and I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; a <unk> <unk> from the side and I penetrate through the body .
Well , maybe a third person sits on me and <unk> his knees .
The comuniqué continues : &quot; Listen to , Sarmad , you really can tell us everything .
Even a days of tea .
I want you to believe that you &apos;re not a weapon with you .
But <unk> , you are using us that you will take the demonstration , then we will have to go to the streets , &quot; he says .
&quot; Well , end , will we hear , &quot; he plays a video I am seeing in a demonstration .
We don &apos;t treat anybody .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Tejar , &quot; a thought looked at my head : You always says that Al Zadjali &apos;s teen .
That , however , can &apos;t be <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of his oral .
Now he starts to speak the only language he understood , and <unk> <unk> on me , with just few short <unk> .
He finally came from an hour , so I guess .
Oddly , I return to my cell .
A thing reads is necessary to give me to me .
Since the first interrogation , I have felt as a state of mercenaries in his ban .
With the head and powerful hands , we treat the same way , the same direction is like every morning .
The same German votes cast out of the walls .
I <unk> down my breath , because with my <unk> is not right . &quot; If you can &apos;t stop , &quot; If you don &apos;t stop going to breathe !
Or , if you want to be a lot of time ? &quot; must be done with something else .
I &apos;m all becoming slow and so quietly .
I &apos;m shaking with fear or cold ?
Ah , which makes difference , can &apos;t hear my teeth .
Then I can go home and release you , so you can also release home .
Who filming you ?
How did you manage to send the footage from the TV station ?
Is there something we don &apos;t know ?
I mean , we all know , but I would hear it from your mouth . &quot;
No time for thinking , there are no longer <unk> , the fewer doubts , &quot; I don &apos;t have been filming .
I would have everything and say that I have nothing done .
I think they are good to do this country . &quot;
I &apos;m worried about you ; I &apos;ve become tired of you now .
Listen to me , Sarmad , you are still young and left your future ahead .
We can <unk> all the doors before the nose , but we can open up thousands of doors .
The decision is coming out of you and join this mobile phone here ; you can find yourself on Facebook or in the language , and you tell you to you , and tell me to anyone who will go to this thing . &quot;
In such a moment , there are any single sentence by the head that the other prisoners had said in their <unk> .
The value of your life is closely associated with the people around you .
You &apos;re huddled into machines - who is not allowed to be a case in danger , and who will be sacrificed if there is no other way ?
My mother often spoke of &quot; <unk> you don &apos;t even wish to speak of his actual enemy . &quot;
&quot; I use my e @-@ mail account only for ordinary conversations .
Well , please , I am able to log into me &quot; after several <unk> on my neck , because I used the wrong phone of these situations ( which I &apos;ve got a false account for these situations ) , a third attempt to take a false account of the third attempt .
Violent web websites , online and dozens online forums .
Nothing of him . &quot; Do you know about a fake whistle or what ?
Isn &apos;t it clear about what is &apos; <unk> &apos; what ?
No problem . &quot;
He &apos;s dominance in the eyes , changing me , embracing his views from the table and depends on the room .
In minutes , without someone who is my <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no whip to me live out of the life .
Then the door stops .
He <unk> me in a hijab and starts , <unk> me .
Stay tuned with my feet .
The screams break away from me .
He continues to go back to previous family <unk> water <unk> to me a <unk> cold water .
For hours , for hours , for hours , I can hear how he is a drink he prepared .
She also smells about cigarettes ; there is the room where we are not allowed to be able to do with permission .
I was fed up , and he wants to go through what I can keep on the legs , with no help on the legs .
After several attempts , I am leaving myself back to my cell .
I was immediately buried in powerlessness .
This is just a <unk> of a <unk> system that is supposed to be done to the crime and the editing editing to the criminals .
It is a system that seeks to give us the illusion of freedom - one of the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship because she is the truth .
Sarmad , you can &apos;t sleep all the day you have to go to stand and attract you . &quot; The voice is Abdel Rahman .
Apparently , I had to read the short moment in which he was like to remember the sounds of the next day .
Like all other here , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from <unk> , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smile left no face when he talks with the other .
In the past , he worked in the prison department in Maputo , and he was able to read many books .
In a raid , several banned books were spotted in him - and some pictures he saw as demonstrator .
Those enough to catch him .
The next day some new prisoners come to the following day .
All talk they are talking about a certain degree of performance , &quot; she says . They were shooting to him to arrest him .
And then he got the <unk> with a knife and <unk> the life so much , &quot; one of the <unk> impressed the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> strength .
He continues : &quot; He is big and strong , and he was growing . &quot;
Another few hours , until the name is called the name .
We all checked us all over the hole to catch a closer look at the <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> young man , and he holds tribute to his legs , to see the <unk> destroyed by the bullet destroyed and his neck .
Those guards are afraid of him !
They &apos;re getting <unk> .
We <unk> in Pekanbaru &apos;s silence , everything to hear what it was completely wrong .
Nothing !
We scare us from our routine , <unk> fate <unk> .
Recovered , when they brought him into the barracks .
The time passes without someone there is a word .
It &apos;s all about his previous work , so they really don &apos;t have a choice , but there is no one choice if there is nothing to do with a sit @-@ out or time ?
The door on the <unk> will be <unk> .
The steps of <unk> come closer .
Our cell is open and <unk> .
Then the door again concludes .
We wait until the guards continue and wash <unk> wounds , head to head .
If we are surrounded by some of these distant countries , we are now killed by fires and would be <unk> , but even protected .
But here &apos;s here as a human being you are on the number ; either you get you with her wounds or her .
Within this year &apos;s time , it has been more awareness of awareness , and after some minutes he can stand it .
He takes his hand on the <unk> !
This is more than a window to a grave ; only the guards and its <unk> use him .
None of us were so close to us .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a pretty young man , and I have a lot of women in the nose .
Do it be your sister among them ?
Is you evil on me ?
Or do I know about Mr. ass and you have since been on my blood ?
If you said , we would have been able to take place peacefully .
No reason to make all these anger . &quot;
Laughing <unk> and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of the others , listen to my family .
We knew that we could die .
Then , we chase them before at least one .
Or do you think that these killers are around us only to kill others because we are afraid of them ?
Tiny - they have much more afraid than we before . &quot;
He seemed unaware of that he would hear guards .
Three of them beat the door and Night Wolves in the cell .
They beat them like fierce <unk> and pushed him out .
It should be the last time that I see military <unk> in Iran &apos;s military camp .

Cuba : Activists and artists alike criminalization of Art · Global Voices

The main thing that was passed in January this year will be passed in December , December , and therefore therefore regulate activities of the cultural sector , including sale of books .
The controversial regulations provide rules within cultural sector and demand for others to afford the artistic services , with the official institutions .
They are also defined by the demands of the demands of the demands , with the authorities that the authorities have the right to do .
Along with the decree , they can also claim the decree &apos;s use of fines and search for tools , equipment and other possessions that were used for the activity activity .
Also , the artistic event will end with immediate effect .
The controversial nature of the norm is also a requirement in one of the articles , which means &quot; the dignity of the people &quot; hurt .
This is a total of discrimination because of the identity or sexual orientation , and violent images of crime , which would be a complete exception in the cultural territories of Cuba .
Many of the decree &apos;s opponents have appeared to be <unk> in the position of the decree , and reports that these controls will reach the reach of artistic news .
One of the most important arguments is that the ability to <unk> the possibilities of independent artist <unk> , and the door would open the door for strict guidelines and censorship that the government is <unk> .
The petition of the decree showed the charge of the decree , arguing with discussions about a new constitution for the Republic of the Republic in Cuba .
But many are the point of the protests against the decree against the decree .
Amid the discussion of the discussion , a group of intellectuals , artists , and activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s Facebook page , and the pro @-@ government activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , the poet Tawfiq Ming , and the rapper David Onetti , the poet Tawfiq Ming , and the rapper David Williams .
Rosemary and David David also contributed to the project &apos;s launch of <unk> .
The campaign is trying to collect 10,000 signatures ; this is the main system in the Cuban constitution to reach a formal norm .
Meanwhile , a petition and an open letter that were shared on Avaaz has joined the discussions to raise the legitimacy of the norm .
In the text , the signatories show their concern for the art and culture in Cuba over the coming years , if stated that state authorities will carry on who will carry their permission to carry out artistic activity and who will grant them funding :
In the meantime , a crowdfunding crowdfunding program offers a collage of friends with new developments .
The fact that a Cuban artist in the situation is possible to fund its own means of creating its own means - millions of people use new technologies to spread their works on the edge of the world .
It also discussed the risks that are linked to any legal rule in the decree , such as punishment of &quot; Smart content towards ethics and cultural values . &quot;
The open letter is aimed at the president of Cuba , Miguel Díaz @-@ <unk> , and has been signed with the new minister of religious religious minister , Miguel Alonso , Coco Nuñez , Coco Nuñez , Coco Nuñez , Coco Nuñez , and Enrique del Macacos .
The concern of the letter will also be shared by the organization Meedia :
Independent artist or those who have no connection with state institutions or groups of civil society are doubly discriminated out against the state of expression and the state &apos;s resources to be seen by the state as a protest .
Moreover , questions related to the norm in religious domains that are taking place in relation to the artistic activity .
This is the case of <unk> de <unk> ( known as <unk> ) , a widespread religion in Cuba , where both dancing and music are part of rituals .
Meanwhile , a hip @-@ hop song depicts the different protests created by artists like David D &apos; <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> based on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and the Standard <unk> by the Band &apos;s Band .
Your censorship is on the closure of concerts that you <unk> .
They &apos;ve always been forced to legalize them .
&quot; You remember the art of art , tell you art
What did you have been in the Constitution sanctions against artists ?
Enough in the repression .
Vinaya Angel Hernández de Hernández de Hernández ( @ miss9afi ) published on the site &apos;s &quot; Del Kozlovsky &quot; Facebook page :
The instant reactions to the decree , the decree &apos;s attitude on the question of a future chaos of censorship and repression ; they are claiming the scope and protection of the financial sources that enable financial sources to provide a role in different levels of the international audience .

It gave me an apology .
&quot; His views are bad for most people . &quot;
The # <unk> movement receives support from many different groups .
Brazilian football fans published a series of explanations , including one of the UESTA Refugee igloo da Juventude , one of the largest and oldest associations that described as the first place :
We and our more than <unk> members realize that it is in a democratic society different online and views .
We are respecting the <unk> as a part of democracy , for our founders .
However , we can &apos;t agree to someone who is opposed to the safety of a democratic person .

To our sisters in Brazil : We are together .
We see and listen to you .

My biggest concern is not even feasible , but those who vote for him .
I don &apos;t know what they want to achieve for the world .
The most consistent human rights groups and the author Joanna embodied the communities to teach why # <unk> was just a hashtag :
Although nothing can be resolved , there &apos;s no reason why we think differently or other ways to look for our indignation .

It is also about how we are talking to politics and be new .

In the midst of the protests and the chaos in Venezuela , our father and her can &apos;t work , but they do not work as much as I know .
Open respect for this lady .
In comparison to her , I am a <unk> . &quot;

It is a part of the economic crisis in Venezuela , which is not spoken by the impact of women and children .
With 44 % of the families in the country where their loved ones are being crying , the women who are sick of the death of their children , are crying to cry the death of their children .
Although the government has been trying to curb the poverty of women in the country , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence are not accused of the government &apos;s independence , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence .
For example , programs of the slums , like Miatta del Barrio ( Women &apos;s mothers and sons of Venezuela ) , has been established in 2011 since 2011 , has been established for a crucial <unk> in extreme poverty since 2011 .
Together both programs between 150 and 350 dollars of the number of children are dependent on the number of children .
On the other hand , abortion in the constitution of Venezuela has been illegal in the constitution of Venezuela as illegal ; a legacy of previous political order of the country that &apos;s otherwise illegal .
Neither Chávez and Maduro have opted to Maduro &apos;s mandate in the 20 years .
Abortion is just allowed when life &apos;s life is in danger .
Aglaia Berlutti , known for the Internet and worker of Global Voices , points the beads of <unk> rhetoric towards gender equality :
... in Venezuela , the Cherokee @-@ based feminism is created by the combination of the Environment &apos;s Environment , and particularly @-@ known .
As a result of the politics character of politics , President Nicolás Maduro identified the validity of President Nicolás Maduro &apos;s administration , who are fighting in the country &apos;s official account , which continues to continue its identity as a historic interpretation of its identity , as a historic interpretation of its identity .
It has not been resolved to solve existing problems : the acute economic crisis is also dangerous .
According to three local organizations for the persecution of human rights , the rate of femicides is one of the world &apos;s femicides in Venezuela .
There are also various cases of sexual abuse against women driving during the protests in 2017 .
In 2016 , the homicide rate in Venezuela reached over 100,000 people - the highest in South America .
After the annual survey of the United Nations Office of the United Nations Office for Refugees and Television ( IRD ) , who published homicide rates in the world .
The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence ( Telecoms Authority de Violencia ) , which is a different method , showed a single method of 89 , which is a percentage of 89 , in 2017 .
Still , according to the conservationists , there were 40 percent of the crimes in Caracas in July 2018 .
Public crime and violence has increased in recent years , and many women have to have to live the death of their children .
In La Mutualité , in the La Mutualité , a citizen media project <unk> personal media coverage of the crisis , reminds their personal coverage of their two children :
After about half a half hours , they called me to pick me to my children .
My heart was jump from the chest when they saw them and me .
Our <unk> were so unbelievable .
No one has seen this way !
They didn &apos;t have a shirt and no shoes she gave me the wrong message of my life .
The story has repeatedly been repeated : They have taken a child .
Furthermore , the permanent absence of sexual harassment in school , with the lack of access to cancer due to shortage in the country , with the shortage of medicines in the country , in high numbers of occupational pregnancies .
Himalayan Kub , a researcher at the Centre of the National Arts Museum of the Central Bank of Venezuela , explains :
... there is a powerful , small but important but a reminder of mothers in the <unk> is a vicious cycle .
Many of the young people are not being carried out .
They would die after eight months in the hospital , and that survive , moving back into neighborhood , to go back to the neighborhood without support of parents .
Ultimately , the women who leave the country with difficulties .
The number of residents of human trafficking in Latin America and Europe have quadrupled in 2014 and 2018 .
In neighbouring Colombia , more than one million Venezuelans arrived in the past year , the women witnessed prejudice and abuse .
Many of the bloggers who have to &quot; steal &quot; the work of the Venezuelan migrants , they are considered to &quot; steal &quot; and crime .
To make up with this fake ideas , the feminist channel Las Basics has produced an article in the Colombian Ministry of Colombia on YouTube .

What the first thing is , it &apos;s against attacks on public and commercial institutions .
In the past two months there was too Protective <unk> , with machetes .
It concerns the population and the government that no one has been known to these attacks .
The <unk> , the nature of the military education and the real types are not clear - but there are some suspects .

A study conducted by the Institute of Social Rights ( ONEMI for Civil Rights ) , published on May 22 , shows that it was a group that highlights its goals in Cabo Delgado and its goals as well as the Islamic Empire &apos;s goals in Cabo Delgado and its goals as the Islamic Federation .
Between November 2017 , February 2017 and February 2018 , three trips to Cabo Delgado , including religious leaders and families of youth who are part of the young groups and families .
Concern &apos;s conclusions indicate that the group was originally known as a conscript @-@ known , a Arab term called &quot; supporters of the most Outrageous tradition and the baboon &quot; , which means &quot; supporters of the most Outrageous tradition and the judiciary &quot; system .
From 2015 , the movement began to integrate military cells .
The study according to the study , members of the Republic of Republic of the Republic of Mozambique ( Zamtel ) , are trained by focusing on gender practices and attitudes from Tanzania and other countries in the region about the Great lakes .
The group is supposed to learn from socially marginalized and not education .
Although they had religious origins and propaganda <unk> , the occupation of the alleged traditional values of Islam , they had the occupation of Cabo Delgado and the establishment of an Islamic state in the north of the country &apos;s north .
This kind of killer has been confirmed by police arrested .
People were ordered to have <unk> to the group , after they promised to be <unk> after the commissions .
The study also shows that the aim is to create illegal <unk> in the region , including wood wood , <unk> , upstream , palm and salt .
The investigator explained that the group is conducting illegal 50,000 revenue per week , which means for the state of 3 million US dollars in the same period .
The start of the &quot; Operation Defensive Edge &quot; by the central government in 2017 , has contributed to the illegal trade of the group , and perhaps the <unk> of the group .
This is also believed to be a part of the insurgents in the southern region of Chicherta , in the south of Qassim , located in the southern province of Ait 13th , where they were declared illegal , before they reached the <unk> budget , given the <unk> of the electoral agency in 2012 .
In February 2017 the government ordered security forces , all illegal weapons that remained in the area , Argentina .
But we have been covering reports of torture by the military in the local press , which has led to a criminal investigation , which has remained no end .
The <unk> characteristic of <unk> <unk> is a society that exists from the English @-@ language community , which is the 75 % of the country , and a political party that ruled the country since independence of 1975 , a political party that ruled the country since independence .
Samora Machel , son of the chief of Culture and Public President Samora Machel is the president of the country &apos;s president .
In just a single one , 2018 took place in Singapore , led by the <unk> of $ 1.15 million of $ 1 million .
For the study of the study , the recruitment of the recruitment of the region is causing the recruitment of financial conditions in the region and the lack of basic social institutions in the region .
According to data from 2016 , the province revives 13 million inhabitants from the year of 2016 , 94 percent of them are unemployed , from 24 % of the age of 15 , 24 % between 15 @-@ 24 years .
Terror and escape
The Mozambican researcher of Human Rights Watch , 64 Machado , visited one of the injured places .
From this woman and hundreds of their neighbors , the houses in decaying Transnistria , located in the northern province of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique , was destroyed only a night in a terror center .
She stayed for nowhere to go .
When I tried to talk with her , she asked me : &quot; Why , why , why , why .
The villages are living in areas without access to electricity , <unk> , <unk> and grass , which are affected by air fires .
If women and children leave them , they only have a few <unk> and small animals .
Given the situation of fear and uncertainty , the government of Cabo Delgado has decided to stop public shipping shipping and equipment in the night , while the United States , England and Portugal have staged travel to the province .
Rebuilding Malawi is on alert .
Accused of love for the love of love as well as human rights activist Yoryie Motlanthe
&quot; If I am very confident , the love that love we are best in each other are legitimate , like the love of heterosexual couples . &quot;

Leif Heimfarth is a young activist and Computer engineer engineer , which featured on Facebook with &quot; <unk> a protocol for sexual diversity in Cuba , &quot; which has almost 150 members of the group in Cuba .
Oddly , his work began as a activist for his experiences as human rights advocates and human rights advocates for the National Center for Forest Policy ( UCAB .
For two years , he elaborated on the University of Computer Science Science in Havana , which is dedicated to preserve sexual health and rights , &quot; Love at a Second Generation &quot; ( love to the second look ) .
In 2014 , he was able to join Latin America and the Caribbean in the 6th regional Summit of the International Lesbian Committee , Gay enthusiasm , weekly and Hebrew Association ( KTB , Global Voices ) , of course , was a transgender and transgender Association .
Currently , he is a member of the Egyptian Nobel Romero Romero Center , where he works with young people who works with social equality .
Finally , the recent debate in Cuba is the current debate in Cuba for anyone who is not recognized by the constitution .
In our conversation , many interesting aspects of the debate was discussed by the level of meaning for the people of marriage , gay rights , transgender , transgender , transgender , bisexual and intersex ( non @-@ economic communities ) communities to regulate the basic lives of citizens .
Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should people be able to legalize their relationship in Cuba in your opinion ?
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think it should be a legal mechanism for it .
Most of the most important events , including those with the environmental expansion of environmental property , is worried that the relationship is recognised and law .
Like this , like this , it &apos;s marriage for all , <unk> or anything else , will depend on what our revolutionaries take place and to overcome our ability to overcome us .
In the international level , there are several countries where it is part of their justice .
We do not have the first step in Cuba .
I personally don &apos;t think a legally @-@ term contract that would guarantee the emotional stability of a relationship , but he can help to protect the heritage of danger and <unk> .
The expansion of the legal law , the right @-@ wing couples to adoption .
It &apos;s a topic where only a few people speak in Cuba .
It is complicated and not free of ethical questions .
GV : Do you think a national referendum will be necessary to determine whether better partnerships between the same gender / <unk> in Cuba should be allowed ?
Rykov : I personally think that the right of people should not be accused of deadly statements , not even those .
However , there are some legal events that can &apos;t be left from eight .
For example , marriage is defined in the Cuban Constitution ( Article 36 ) as &quot; A volunteer Telecommunications Group between a man and a woman who can be seen legally to live live . &quot;
The video shows common communities .
Some important revisions can be introduced here as a recognition in the recognition of the recognition of a formal marriage , without a formal marriage .
This second option seems to be the easiest , but it has limited access to reach .
If they are able to accomplish money , marriage would still be a gay right / privilege for couples of different gender equality during same @-@ sex community or <unk> community , that would have to highlight discrimination .
However , I should understand that a communications connection between people of the same sex is only one point in the agenda of sexual diversity .
That &apos;s why I should think the point of all legal initiative will be discussed , and the agenda will be seen as such as activists and organizations .
Regardless of equality in marriage , <unk> said :
I think <unk> is <unk> .
By the story , marriage is a tool to legalize the <unk> , <unk> and the Jewish @-@ Christian standards .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give a chance , but I think the debate did not reach the <unk> that they should have .
That &apos;s why I would like to address questions about future debates in the room :
Why is marriage equality in such a lot of headlines ?
What place should they take place in the Agenda &apos;s Agenda ?
Does it make sense to fight marriage , just because the right ?
What is the real blow to this legal mechanism ?
If we speak about the recognition of relationships by African couples , this is the only connection between two people ?
What happened to the <unk> relationships ?
Should their suggestions come from <unk> ?
What will affect the marriage marriage system for trans people , which has access to medicine and <unk> priority ?
Will the marriage change change for a lesbian woman supporting a fellow of an Ethiopian woman in Cuba ?
Because the <unk> of the Ministry of Public health is not sufficient for heterosexual couples , it wouldn &apos;t be a requirement that must be a couple of <unk> .
GV : Do you know a case or a foreign scientist in Cuba where people who learned not to be recognized by the recognized role ?
abcnoman011 : I are many cases .
One of this is a friend of a friend that was founded after his partner of his partner partner .
It &apos;s a <unk> story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased was pushed out from the house .
After his death , the father almost received all his possessions of his son .
Since the community was not recognized , there was almost no legal situation .
Moreover , there are widespread <unk> ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) , and more places for couples that are poor @-@ sex couples .
GV : Last four years ago , a commenter named assembled Martínez Hernández , under an article published by the newspaper <unk> ( CCP , the Chinese Communist Party ) , is the following comment : &quot; Marriage for All of us , disrespectful , and it would be as much as recognition of treaties between people and animals .
It should not be legal because it is not normal .
There are couples who spend their entire lives without married to the decriminalization of something that is not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer this way ?
Note : To all this , I want the comment that the comment you object , was motivated by an article which appeared on May 6 , 2014 .
In an article published by journalist Suzgo University , a journalist at the beginning of the International Lesbian Committee , Gay wrote of previous times , personally personally , personally <unk> .
Mother comment reflects the personal perspectives of someone who is open to all the marriage .
It &apos;s his opinion , and I respect it but that &apos;s a great ignorance of the matter .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is so rare , how the Misdemeanors Cathedral itself is .
What is normal and of course , it &apos;s not well for the other may and vice versa .
For this , it &apos;s a long time about the truth .
During the time of slavery , the purpose of a person became a &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; of course , something what &apos;s the punishable of the punishable .
If there is one thing I am very convinced I am very convinced that the love we are gay people , as the love that we are in love , are the love of people to explain each other .

The Constitutional Court in Guatemala .

The next 48 hours are crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court demanded the government in an unprecedented verdict , citing Colombian lawyers in the country , and the return of his work to the United Nations Commission for the International Commission of the International Commission against impunity in Guatemala ( suspected <unk> la <unk> en Guatemala ) on the basis .
In recent month , Guatemala &apos;s President Jimmy Morales announced the mandate of the mandate of the equation and <unk> , who is currently in the United States , is returning to Guatemala &apos;s return to Guatemala .
The decision has sparked both national and international outrage and resulted in an international outcry and protests of conflict .
Earlier , the Commission of Morales and members of his family accused corruption of his family in the space , which obligates Morales , and his subscribers has now been responsible for which the Constitutional Court is responsible for the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not just a test to the democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors of the president who supported the president in the past .
According to a official statement , Morales could require the approval of a ban on the approval of the country &apos;s approval to be issued .
Journalists such as Nina Karua and other commenters on social media shows the current situation , and the various degrading scenarios , especially if Morales should be requested to support the ruling year and support the army :
Guatemala : The Court of Constitutional Court is final .
Unfortunately , in the sense of the constitution , it is not possible to ignore the ruling that @ <unk> against President @ <unk> &apos;s president .
What will he do and do the leaders of the leaders ?
Does the constitution be able to fail or <unk> a coup ?
Human rights activists , including the arrival of human rights groups , have reacted with relief and confidence , but also with concerns about the government &apos;s next steps :
Reliable news of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It had to be done .
The respectable Constitutional Court is making public order again .
What could happen next 48 hours to return to Guatemala &apos;s next 48 hours ?
A political blow ?
In the past few months in Guatemala , the political turmoil against corruption and the political turmoil in Guatemala have played a very special significance .
This is how the political rise of Morales , after a human rights movement , and impunity that have formed large parts of the political class , and the regime of then President Otto Pérez Molina .
In the political crisis , the Commission &apos;s presence and its investigation was expected to be an important role in the country &apos;s political crisis .
Now , where Morales are in the midst of political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment in Guatemala &apos;s protection to protect its democratic institutions in the protection of its democratic institutions .
Salvadoran journalist Héctor Silva highlighted thesis on the significance between Morales - and Morales &apos; President &apos; :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala with a support of <unk> groups , including some links with links to military news site .
When he took office , he said he was neither an thief or a thief .
Today he is a president who <unk> by <unk> power to prevent him that corruption will be investigated against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # MozQuerPaz ( resignation of &quot; resignation &quot; ) , which was used in 2015 , has hosted new followers and protests in the street .
At the same time , international media in the region have highlighted international media from the region as the Colombian newspaper El País in the region and called the international community to track further developments in the country :
Regardless of the <unk> changes , the situation continues to take place in the midst of the country , and that <unk> is a thorn in a thorn in the matter , without even trying to stay with the issue of journalism .
Therefore , the international community has to protect the people of Guatemala to protect its institutions and search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be on Guatemala &apos;s claims in its <unk> in its <unk> , which could result in the outcome of a similar impact on the history of a similar scale .
Is this the last <unk> <unk> in <unk> ?

In the hills of the northern <unk> in western India , the community of solidarity is a peaceful and difficult life .
From the hills , the Echo of songs filling the songs for each work .
They are not average villagers , the decades of staying in the same place , and a astronomical revenue .
They are more respectful , like their name suggests , &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> and can roughly roughly be translated by &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of the <unk> . &quot;
However , during the past generations , however , there are a return to a debt that could be lost in <unk> <unk> in <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk> saw many challenges such as climate change , economic infrastructure , and the physical infrastructure of a police officer in a city .
Since the 1960s , when closed borders closed in the 1960s , these challenges have increased .
The lives of a <unk> race is a key fight , with the result that the number of people who are willing to take on traditional life constantly yields .
A year ago , the annual stream of Tibet , where she was originally <unk> in the northern areas of Sikkim to <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
During the spirit of the <unk> , they fired temporarily near heavy shelters in Tibet where the grass was longer and <unk> , and not through the weight of the sugar mill .
In the summer , they moved towards south in the northern region of Sikkim , and remained some time in areas such as golf , <unk> , <unk> and laughter .
There were bosses of the laughter of the laughter valley with the <unk> that is not only economically , but also culturally for both sides .
The trade was to cultural exchange and struggle for the two communities .
In exchange , the <unk> surrounding the livestock and sold , which remained the norm , headed to their own , rose <unk> community with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This exchange of agreement between Tibet and India has been relieved , as well as through the open borders that belonged to the non @-@ immigration organization , without <unk> .
Following the occupation occupation of China , the border was closed and the <unk> were forced to relocate one of the two sides .
Since then , the film has been restricted to a region , both in winter and in the summer .
Dr. Anna Pesquera , Senior Manager at the Graduate Institute of Forest Affairs in Sikkim , told that the Prosecutor &apos;s Office is the claim that the group &apos;s claims that there was about 1,000 lashes in front of the park , which had a re @-@ year anniversary of the origin of the origin of the film .
Currently , there are fewer than 12 families that lead to the traditional lives of the <unk> .
Other members of the community have found multiple jobs and most of them attempted to relocate in smaller towns .

Because of all odds , everyone stood together
The traditional way of transportation is not easy .
Using their territory in the state of Sikkim , they are exposed to the state of Sikkim , they are facing more heavy snowfall in the northern areas of Mindanao , due to more heavy snowfall in the green waters of the <unk> .
&quot; If it &apos;s snow , it is very difficult for the animals like us for the animals such as for us , &quot; says Onyando <unk> in a Film institute called &quot; Manual Introductorio on the border with the title of Northern Congo . &quot;
They rely on <unk> on <unk> , but heat is growing in a problem .
According to Frommer &apos;s average temperature , the average temperature in Sikkim is increasing around 2.5 degrees .
This has led to a <unk> of <unk> , and the heat is preparing for the benefit of people to care .
The <unk> animals will be forced to be a exposure and the <unk> are forced to sell them either or give them <unk> <unk> because the grass in winter is covered with snow .
This means a additional place to buy the <unk> .
This is a relatively new community for the traditional community of travelling with goods that are based on their daily demand for goods and their offerings .
Since the procedure , the community has to leave the army as well as they can &apos;t afford to find medical aid at medical aid , even though the army can &apos;t afford to afford with poorer diseases .
In such cases , the simple survival is sensitive .
To understand the problem , you have to find out that <unk> is a central role in the community of ways they can deliver and add milk and milk to add to different products , and they will add milk and milk .
From <unk> things are things like <unk> , clothing and <unk> .
In previous times , more expensive vendors were also identified , <unk> and <unk> , from <unk> <unk> , which were mainly represented in Tibet and served as a <unk> .
The majority of the struggle has been suspended .
In the winter of winter , the milk genre for tea is known for tea - in the neighborhood of Chai , and in the summer of the summer , in the summer and the summer of summer .
With a rare farm , one of which was typically sold in place , which is now sold in place , where a businessman has now been a rare one .
For all these years , however , the mistress will still be seen as guests and not as residents of the area .
They are trapped and must be <unk> , not only because they are able to attract each other because they are able to add the rules and regulations of the LGBTI communities .
A uncertain future for the profession of the Environment
Yet , despite all this backdrop , some <unk> a living is a living of a living living .
They <unk> the gaps that they hold over <unk> of <unk> villages in laughter and <unk> for the army .
In addition to <unk> , clothes , food , and other parts of the world , have to bear the cost of their children in the expense of their children , when they decided to send their children to schools in schools .
After their education and urban life , the children are being used to return to the children and <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , &quot; If everything else , life is the life of the last way , &quot; says Dr. Anna Kanafy .
Young men have also come back to work as a result of their work because they would not find any bride .
Those who divide the profession of the <unk> , are mostly part of the army , the government or other urban jobs .
With the recent rise in tourism in <unk> in <unk> , jobs are also asked in this sector .
Those who don &apos;t find their jobs in the Tibetan &apos;yōshū .
Neither the government &apos;s responsibilities is still supporting the interest of some of the less @-@ non @-@ profit organizations for the young people to continue the traditional way of life .
Despite all this , there are those who take care of the traditional work of <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But even they are aware that their children would decide to sell the livestock to sell their livestock in cities and take other jobs .
This a generation could easily be the last chapter in <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .

Ali Qatifaan was 21 years old when he arrived in July 2013 as a <unk> to Australia from a boat to Australia .
After 6 months , he was transferred to the island @-@ based refugee camps in Papua of Australia , foreign refugee camps in Papua @-@ Guinea , where he should spend the next four years of his life .
On Thursay , he began to draw cartoons about cartoons to overcome his <unk> , making the situation and other asylum seekers .
He took the <unk> of &quot; Fish Fish &quot; ( skinned fish ) , who has pop up at a high seas in 2013 .
After almost three years of imprisonment , the media started to publish its cartoons , the cartoons of the refugees on Manus .
Some of the cartoons also reveal their health and sexual abuse that he had learned in the camp .
In 2016 , he was awarded his work by the Inter @-@ European Network International Rights Network ( The International Network for Conservation of Women &apos;s Rights ) Award in 2009 .
The reason for his award is : &quot; His cartoons will be seen as a day from <unk> of the worst human behavior of the worst human behavior since the World War II . &quot;
Australia is being criticised from the world due to the situation in the refugee camps .
The United Nations has the most political line in the prison @-@ torn detention center in the underground camp to &quot; combine , inhumane and degrading punishment . &quot;
Ali was released in December 2017 after a global campaign for his release .
On 17 December , he reached military support in Norway by the support of the International Cities of Slovyansk Network .
On e @-@ mail , we interviewed Ali nearly a year after he has been called &quot; a exit in freedom . &quot;
He talked about his life after his arrest , experiences in the refugee camp , and shared advice for other artists who are persecuted for others .
Ali knew that even though he is happy with his new life in Norway , it was very difficult for it to adapt .
After two weeks , I fell into a deep depression , which was even more than five months , until it was done with the help of a psychologists and a few friends .
He remembered his decision to understand cartoons from a medical employee after he ordered an medical employee to shut down his <unk> , but even though it wasn &apos;t easy - with other things , the detainees didn &apos;t have access to paper and pen .
I was fed up until 2014 , and I had no sufficient paper , and I had to find enough paper papers , and I had to find a lot of paper , and I had to find a lot of years until I was able to build my writings on someone .
And this was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The art didn &apos;t help me <unk> <unk> , but it has helped me to help my voice to people outside the world outside the camp .
It was the art that saved me , my life was saved my life .
His paintings brought their attention to the attention of medical rescuers and the <unk> machine on the first hand , then on Manus .
Later , Australian media have been reporting on his art to his art in the aftermath of the tribunal :

This is Ali &apos;s prayer to identify artists , especially young artists who are subjected to crackdown :
Don &apos;t stop stop what you do .
Stay tuned , keep cartoons , send your voice in the world .
It takes his time , it takes place , but it &apos;s work .
No action .
I asked for help for help I &apos;ve asked for help .
I have given my freedom after a number of people asked for help after I asked .
To ask help is not shameful .
He also asks that groups who offer refugees to take care of the refugees in the camp to give false information about the situation in the camp .
The truth has helped me .
The truth helped me to get back my freedom .
It took long , but it didn &apos;t work
