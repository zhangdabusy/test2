In a variety of places , especially in West Africa , migration has been established as &quot; <unk> &quot; it .
There is a lot of migration to find migration as ordinary as migration in neighbouring countries , the most common type of migration , especially in West Africa - or whether there is a huge distance to the migration , especially in West Africa .
Europe is not always the target of migration .
Sicilian writes :
These travel is often a particular place .
You can download half half of a place for a time to work and earn money .
After then , you will continue to continue and maybe another place for some time .
Or you will be deported from the country to be deported .
The whole thing is a lot and <unk> as the <unk> way to Europe as he is often represented .
Without jobs and opportunities in their <unk> , it will be as the <unk> decision to leave home and make better ways .
Just as a young person &apos;s decision , a decision to take advantage of dignity .
The young people is often expected to be <unk> for their parents and other family members , &quot; says Onyando .
Judge agrees : &quot; It &apos;s about to improve the situation at home .
Among the young people in Mali have deep inspiration towards his country .
There is a basic critic of mistrust that the political system will help . &quot;
For the young people , which can be expected by them , and they can take their clan as adults , they hope outside their country .
As long as the situation in their homeland will not change , young people will take on the way to other places .
&quot; It will be OK , &quot; he says ?
In the words , &quot; It will be OK &quot; for the young Guineans in their country .
But who can be the guarantee that the situation will be OK ?
Like many other campaigns in the EU , the video makes the accent solely solely solely on the migration threats and mentioned opportunities that young people in their home are not explicitly <unk> .
Of course , the opinion is : &quot; If they want to preserve the message home , they would have to show some of the opportunities that are there there . &quot;

The passport by Miguel Wilkinson is known as his life .
&quot; The passport is in fact .
It is my name , my <unk> and <unk> , &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old , &quot; said the 22 @-@ year @-@ old voice , points out the document .
&quot; I don &apos;t want it .
He is not red as the passports of all other and the word doesn &apos;t want to sell .
I am not a or there else . &quot;
With its identification ID , Miguel varieties of identification can travel , but they don &apos;t want to know his nationality .
Stay wait for Miguel in the last stage in the trial to end the full smart nationality .
For example , <unk> is one of the most obvious people who have been reported after the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in Georgia , but there are no nationality .
They are only one of the most accomplished 10 million eligible countries across the world , but the consequences are not less <unk> .
&quot; Without you , you &apos;re a non @-@ citizens , &quot; explained Zhelezniak , the principal representative of the UNHCR in Georgia .
&quot; This means you don &apos;t have access to health and education .
You can &apos;t vote , no one can go to the bench , you can &apos;t go to marry or car . &quot;
It also means that there is no right to a formal funeral or a <unk> .
Miguel had not been <unk> until 2015 .
20 , he received the status status of his status .
Oddly , not knowing when he couldn &apos;t exist in the window of the law .
He was born as a son of an Nigerian father and a mother in Tbilisi &apos;s 13 @-@ Armenian mother , until age , after age three years old , he had a Russian passport .
When his mother visited Tbilisi &apos;s family in Tbilisi , she said her passport was allegedly .
He did not want his grandchildren to be Russian oppositionist , told him .
This should be reversed as a result of the decision .
Initially , with his mother , sitting with his mother .
But after a <unk> , they had to <unk> , <unk> .
While he <unk> his memories , he leaves the sight from his hands and let &apos;s leave each other .
He learned that it can be dangerous .
&quot; I just remember that my mother and I started to sleep on the street , &quot; he says , &quot; when I was 11 years old .
I didn &apos;t go to school .
I immediately came out everywhere . &quot;
Documentation films were apparently missing .
A 22 @-@ year @-@ old Miguel faction was born in Moscow , when he moved his mother to Tbilisi .
His father - allegedly a Nigerian <unk> - disappeared before a long time ago .
A fresh encounter with a people who loved as a lawyer for the UNHCR to end the full @-@ estate program brought him back in the circles of interior .
His case has been issued by state officials of the Ministry of Justice and a year later , received a identification officer as a <unk> .
This cable gives the same rights as any other citizens leave the right to vote and the right to work in public service .
Right now , he lives in a dormitory for homeless in Tbilisi and waiting for the anticipated decision of his nationality in 1910 .
However , the respectable passport is a lot more than just a document .
&quot; You see in my face that I &apos;m different , &quot; he says , &quot; he says , &quot; he says .
&quot; I speak of <unk> , but not like a camp .
I speak there , but I don &apos;t see an Armenians .
I speak Russian , but also not like an Russian .
It &apos;s all that I need to be a need to heal the wound of the non @-@ cooler . &quot;
Without documents , it is difficult for the <unk> Miguel incredibly .
In 2017 , he was working as a security camp in a room where devices can be free to use it .
He is not the only one with this wish .
According to the dissolution of the Soviet Union collapse , the border between the different states were set up as a result of millions of people in a row .
By adequate obstacles , the territorial conflict or very simple because documents from a recent era were no more <unk> , they were to &quot; strangers . &quot;
In Georgia , thousands of people live by separatist conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia countries , Georgia tries to have a sense of belonging to a sense of belonging .
Two years on the street with his mother , Miguel slab was taken in Tbilisi &apos;s street <unk> in Tbilisi .
He shares a room with two other people .
This is how Georgia signed a United Nations Convention on the Convention for fundamental rights and protection of basic rights .
Since then , the UNHCR has found the exact number of <unk> , the process of the government &apos;s reputation of citizenship and health workers were trained in their identification centers in the <unk> centers .
The number of people have been receiving undocumented citizenship in the past three years , according to official figures , according to official figures , the number of people in Georgia has been about 49 percent .
Eventually , a &quot; dire problem &quot; is a &quot; dire problem , &quot; says UNHCR workers .
&quot; Politics must have the will to solve this problem . &quot;
However , as a result , domestic knowledge among members of ethnic minorities and in rural communities have one of the largest obstacles .
&quot; Education is very low , &quot; says Osnat Gillor , the founder of the Environmental and Fi Centre , a non @-@ profit organization in Tbilisi who promotes access to state businesses .
&quot; The people aren &apos;t able to understand that the effects of the leaks can &quot; have no comment on them in the park . &quot;
Science lives in a small neighborhood outside Tbilisi , and runs a own <unk> on the market .
It was only that they had no correct documents when they have no correct documents .
The 59 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> is such a human being .
She was born in Grozny in Grozny that is born in today &apos;s Russia , which was 1980 , in which she went to Georgia to work there .
The only document she needed then was its Soviet <unk> because it &quot; haven &apos;t been borders . &quot;
In the 1990s , she moved to Tbilisi , but today &quot; Don &apos;t go anywhere anywhere from her &quot; &quot; says lawyer , &quot; says lawyer , referring to <unk> and children .
At the end of 2016 , when a hospital was asked after her identification , declaring that her Soviet passport and her only <unk> was away .
She searched her passport , but she couldn &apos;t find her passport .
Thirty @-@ Leste &apos;s case was posted on the public registry of the UNHCR , along with UNHCR and the Georgian Institute of Community Research and Roberto Centre , seeking to determine their legal status .
No red means no health .
Even though <unk> Soviet passport is no longer <unk> , &quot; it would be possible to clarify that their legal status , &quot; says Mejia .
&quot; There are no information about them in the contest , no information . &quot;
Through research in the underground and interviews with family @-@ related family and other people , they are now trying to prove their right to <unk> their identification cards for several months .
From war in a <unk>
Violeta Camarasa ( 49 ) left her village village in Abkhazia , in 1992 of the war between Tbilisi &apos;s war between Tbilisi .
She then did not arrive until they don &apos;t return .
For a long time , the goal is to get citizenship .
In the case of 49 @-@ year @-@ old Tea , 2004 , the two years was the two years .
tribe is ethnically ethnically ethnic and left her home home in 1992 for the beginning of a day in 1992 after she was carrying her allegiance to the <unk> of Georgian government .
Violeta Camarasa , here with her Spanish @-@ language lover of Life , received a child living in 2014 .
She lives in a suburb of Tbilisi today .
She knows exactly when she was non @-@ citizen , it was shortly after the general parliamentary elections in Georgia .
&quot; I forget my bag with my documents in a taxi .
There was a big chaos .
I never found the driver . &quot;
At the same time , <unk> is a <unk> on the market in Tbilisi , and they tried to receive a official identification ID in Tbilisi .
With her post @-@ <unk> heritage , she says , she &apos;s going back to the world of a migrant boy .
For hundreds of other people , this goes on .
Two childhoods is full of the only largest people .
The 49 @-@ year @-@ old has heard nothing from her family since she left her hometown of Abkhazia since September 1992 .

The viral social media campaign # <unk> ( # MondayOfBlogsOnGlobalVoices , as well as # <unk> ) forced China &apos;s most popular social media platform Weibo designed to implement censorship by LGBT content .
The move does not mean that LGBT voices will continue to be silenced online , but there is a major <unk> <unk> from the places of <unk> .
On April 13 , Weibo plans to take a tough crackdown on cartoons , Games , and partnerships with the cartoons , plans to control the public control and &quot; Socialist <unk> &quot; in China &apos;s Tourism Law , which airs the state of state security .
The direct nature of LGBT content does not exist in the law .
The company explained clearly that LGBT content would be directly affected , and there were already deleted stories from the subject of registering a total of 62 <unk> , apples , and <unk> .
The next day , &quot; LGBT minorities &quot; published a popular LGBT flag , a popular LGBT flag , a popular LGBT media statement :
Due to circumstances , outside of our control , the editorial @-@ based work of LGBT troops appeared on Weibo .
During this time , we will not be using the official Weibo account of LGBT propaganda .
I want to thank all the Weibo users who have been supporting us since 2009 .
All comment , Like and Share , is a voice for love .
Let &apos;s hope for a better morning .
The above post was shared more than 240,000 .
A large number of Weibo users started shortly after posting the news on the hashtag # <unk> as a protest against censorship .
In less than a week the hashtag has been used 500,000 and received around 500 million calls .
confidential censors attempted to take part in the removal of the protest , but did not have the continued number of users and foreign media users who have now followed the events .

Within 48 hours , 10 outside of China &apos;s Daily rarely reported the incidents and the government &apos;s Deputy People responded to the decision , and the @ Weibo affair changed its decision and will not be found in the list of content content .
All that should be transformed into history .
With you to our side , the LGBT community is strong .
We will continue to be healthy , scientific and physical LGBT content so that the public can be a inclusive and understanding of our community .
This is the best way to offer discrimination .
LGBT rights advocates will remain diplomatic and the Chinese LGBT community is ready to serve .
However , this is only a barrier that has been evicted from the way .
The SouthAfrica WorldCupBlog was not an isolated case , nor it was a quick mistake of the company .
It was led by confidential pressure .
LGBT content has been on the focus of <unk> in recent years .

July 2015 : A popular online opinion agency , &quot; I should have to come to the State Administration of the Press , Publication , Radio , Film and Television of China , according to the State Administration of Press , Moscow , film and Television of China , SARFT , and Television of China .
The official reason for the ban was that the guests have been acting against &quot; <unk> &quot; sexual behavior , and that the program <unk> values and morality values .
At the same time , the German government &apos;s commitment to be able to do will be able to do anything more likely to speak more of the public domain , but it does not mean that LGBT content will stay in the next <unk> .

It is not surprising that Erdogan &apos;s clumsy <unk> is difficult to find it difficult to find a electorate at almost 60 million cast views , including about 1.5 million new voters .
Erdogan then denies that the generous coverage of the generous reporting that has received its campaign from national television and other pro @-@ government mass media .
&quot; Give me a example .
Where and what the campaign has blocked a state of emergency ? &quot; he asked this week in his hometown of Letpadan in the Black Sea of Turkey .
He also pointed out that the state of emergency could be avoided .
It is also recognized that the most important president , president of Erdogan &apos;s election .
His opponents were quickly removed from him .
This exchange is not just a curious relief from a tense political atmosphere , but also offers important insights into the political atmosphere , but also offers an important perspective on the government , his three most important opponents and Turkish voters is really important .

A campaign in Japan offers special comprehensive metal base systems that can handle them on <unk> and <unk> on <unk> and similar harassment .
The Joint Prevention Prevention Center ( e.g. : soy infections ) organized this campaign already in his third year .
The Japanese word &quot; <unk> &quot; will be used as well as the public domain as well .
The francophones contain different messages that readers would point out that a crime is a crime and that doesn &apos;t let this happen .
With wearing the &quot; <unk> guy &quot; <unk> , girls show how much they hate .
In order to understand that this is necessary to determine that they should stop sexual harassment and attacks .
In fact , women who drive up with the train , are often very often .
According to Japan Times :
The figures of the survey suggests that merit cases of domestic abuse or harassment were reported in 2017 , 30 per cent of domestic deaths between 7 and 9 am at the Sultanate .
Over 50 percent of the cases continue in trains , according to the report , and another 20 percent of Delhi .
In the same time , there were reports that nearly 30 percent of the respondents are the girls .
Ancient media applicants are being treated by the police according to Section Report of Penal Code .
It is also reported that it is difficult to continue such cases .
Although the police and the more active campaigns to stop the <unk> in trains , these embassies are most likely to stop the women who are able to stop themselves from the start of the world .
Comments on the comments is often trying to determine what such behavior and media is very critical about how men can speak out of false accusations on the ground .
I don &apos;t do it anymore !
Sexual harassment is a crime !
Activist Noriko Rakotoarison , who represents the <unk> Center of Environmental Center ( about neurotoxic crowdfunded activities ) , says that the idea of the teacher &apos;s teacher was the first time of a student and her mother , a friend of <unk> .
In her first year in college , the girl was sitting at a day when the school was harassed and beaten by school workers :
&quot; The perpetrators didn &apos;t have a sign of <unk> . &quot; This doesn &apos;t want to live again , &quot; she decided .
And they created a map where reads :
&quot; I don &apos;t do it anymore !
Sexual harassment are a crime ! ! &quot;
Then the girl took this map to their <unk> and walked with the school .
She was never tired .
Soweyda reported that the girl &apos;s campaign had been made on social media in 2015 , and it was the idea of the idea with the <unk> .
In 2016 , Japan Times reported :
This post was collected in November with a crowdfunding project ( <unk> ) in November with a crowdfunding project and had 2.12 million JPY ( $ euro ) .
To ensure that the young women would take this design , &quot; she collected recommended design ideas from encouraging people to take part in the event .
In January , 2013 , Gandhi was also launched in front of the informal Autonomous Center ( ICG to prevent sexual harassment ) to prevent awareness about this issue .
The idea of this anti @-@ campaign campaign is that the girls can raise awareness about the harassment and that the society is not <unk> :
The concept of this <unk> :
:
- None of the <unk> <unk> will be
- No one will be a <unk>
- No one seems to be accused of <unk>
In 2015 , the 6th edition of January 2015 was offered for sale on 500 degrees ( CAD 4 euros ) for sale on the Internet .

&quot; Pretty <unk> , <unk> ... &quot; - a comic of self @-@ censorship , which has published its interpretation of the Macedonian nationalist category , in 2011 , by citizens for a unified Macedonia .
Used with permission .
While the most citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have seen the <unk> of Greece with Greece as a serious issue , some are using humor and satire .
Greece has long been struggling to have a name called for a name that has been exposed to <unk> the neighbouring Greek region and the ancient Greek kingdom .
Thus , it is important to ensure that Greece will be blocked to the European Union of European Union ( EU ) and NATO ( NATO ) , as long as the name is not allowed to be changed to the Greek scene of Greece .
This has led to some levels of xenophobia in two countries .
Most of the residents of the <unk> see the blockade as a <unk> form of terrorism while many Greeks believe their northern neighbors are going to throw a wish for ride .
The nationalists of both countries have expressed their feelings of humiliation and frustration , creating the problem and draw attention to political praise for &quot; patriotism &quot; .
Indeed , the country &apos;s most popular Russian @-@ language strategy to prevent power from EU and NATO in the Balkan region .
The only place in the botched area of Macedonia and Greece is that it is not a smile .

As a sign of protest , Greece will take place .

The operation will take place until Monday .
The cost of action will be increasing for several million euros .

Protesters and journalists in Nicaragua online and on the street threatened &quot; Stop the blockades , &quot; a often welcoming call under the supporters of the former president Daniel Ortega .
It comes to the blockade that have been built in different locations around Nicaragua to be seen as a means of protest against the government &apos;s communal population and cars .
Sequence from a picture shared on social media .
Since April 18 , 2018 , the chaos and rights of protesters and the media are directly threatened .
As protesters , who were demanding more social security and government accountability , have been attacked by the police , the military and other members of the government , were attacked and their equipment were attacked and their source were stolen .
According to the report by the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights ( TeleAndes ) , enthusiastic people died during the protests or carried through fire , including the Holy Angel Division who was shot as he was killed on April 21 .
Online censorship and intimidation of journalists and protesters constantly use .
Several independent online news agencies reported attacks on their websites that have even been brought into some cases .
This week , publications are also reported that their mini @-@ based social networks were hacked and <unk> with a pro @-@ government slogan .
Just now , where the calls for a government will be louder , the consequences of these measures will be stronger because of access to information , if we need access to information .
How everything started
The crisis began on April 18 , when the government - led by President Daniel Ortega and his wife of Rosario , one of the country &apos;s president , is one of the judiciary - one of the edict , which has been forced to reach 5 % , and the fees for labor workers and employers
pensioners and students reacted to peaceful demonstrations to protest the decision and began to protest with police and members of the &quot; Youth Youth &quot; , a paramilitary gang .
Then the chaos broke out .
Some protesters also report that police took a live ammunition against them .
After the failed attempt to reach a peaceful solution to a peaceful solution to the conflict , many are calling on his resignation .
Inevitable assault on Journalists

In the killers , there were his opinion , after members of the local youth youth , where his passport and cell phone were stolen from his investigative work .
As it seems , the attackers had threaten the attackers and prevent him from his work as a journalist in his work as a journalist .

They beat me on the face and my lips <unk> .

I wanted to violate him with the manipulation of the <unk> , and I asked him , the others said , &quot; let him tell him .

But I don &apos;t have a phone , but that &apos;s all the communication .
Thanks to all those who have worked with me and offered to live with them .

In the midst of protests against social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , state control has reached control of new measures .
In June 2018 , Venezuelans have had to appear to appear to seem to recognize the Venezuelans &apos; highest measure , and the latest measure is the most important measure to limit access to public populations .
The path was long and counting .
As of the late president of the late president Hugo ChÃ¡vez and TV , President NicolÃ¡s Maduro started to radio and TV , with President NicolÃ¡s Maduro , who has been led by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro in a business model where the state has moved to the state or <unk> influence on their belts and commercial activities .
Moreover , the National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) - the ANC &apos;s National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) - which was carried out earlier at the depths of the National Constituent Assembly , was a controversial law that was organized by social media , and is a controversial video that is called &quot; hate &quot; or away .
You have already been able to determine that people have been arrested because of tweets , it seems that it has been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has been causing a huge shortage of goods and basic services such as paper , electricity , and <unk> .
The shortage of political access to information and news has access to information and news has a tense level of communication and spreading information .
Newspapers go online ... and will then be blocked
With the low rise rise in food prices , local newspapers were forced to stop their expenses , but local newspapers have been forced to stop their expenses or free online to stop their expenses , without guarantee their readers .
At the beginning of 2018 , a journalist tweeted :
The Bangladesh edition of El weblogs is reported to be blocked in various locations .
I watched today that my computer access to El weblogs , La Propaladora and other Venezuelan pages that are &quot; unpleasant &quot; for the dictatorship .
Does others have the problem ?
This can be a result of a police report .
Months later , in early June , journalists on Twitter and other media outlets reported that El Forum was blocked , one of the most important newspapers in the country :
It &apos;s a El app on the server <unk> : <unk> <unk>
&quot; It &apos;s not about shepherding , it &apos;s going &quot;
Kaghz PÃºblico , a organization that defended free expression and access to information , condemned on their Twitter account that telecommunications service platforms , blocking online content , using online content and communication services .
The measure is taking advantage of the public and the media inside both and abroad .
K.R. Arouri explains what clearly made the impression of morality and decency :
The question of being raised here is how it could come to this point .
Each thing would say that Chavism is a regime that has already become a regime that has already followed the society .
Those who try to push him into the way will be reached by a full rule of society .
Other users began quick to analyze the real reach of the measure and their close ties with online censorship - one of Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main problem is not only the block of pornographic websites , which is so far , but that the ban will also spread on other sites .
What does they use blocking of porn sites ?
They obliged the blocking of other pages to be the next one .
However , other users suggest that there is no case for censorship .
They crossed broadband Internet and the government &apos;s control of the issue :
The blocking of porn sites is neither absent , nor it has been created because the government wants to protect children .
The reason for Venezuela is that Venezuela has no money to pay the scope of these pages that will require them to comply with Internet access .
What kinds of alternatives is there ?
Perhaps Tor can help ... or not not .
Tor is a free software , which is used to be used to be anonymous , and it allows it to use the internet as well as Tor .
The ban on Tor &apos;s network network seems to block Tor , and therefore not entirely effective .
Still , organizations like Acceso Libre or Ssuuna Sin confirms that Tor was blocked .
They beat solutions to end these restrictions :
We can confirm that Tor ( in direct link ) is blocked @ <unk> , you can use it with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
The website is reported on blocking of the Twitter user @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To bypass censorship , using bridges , use bridges and Tor :

Oluwakemi Djemal ( 51 ) , a prime minister in Russia , was killed in the Central African Republic on July 31 , 2018 , from Echo of Slovyansk , YouTube .

Geidar Djemal , a junior role in junior case , and his two colleagues , award @-@ winning award , was shot by unknown figures from the checkpoint , was shot by unknown figures from the checkpoint .
The attack occurred amidst a ongoing conflict between the country &apos;s government and different groups .
The death of three journalists was confirmed by the Chilean Control Center ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which is currently based in London by his former photographer Mikhail Khodorkosvky , who is currently living in London .
According to The Straits Times , Russia supported the past with weapons and <unk> the country &apos;s security forces in the past with weapons .
Compassion , <unk> and directors were assigned in the Central African Republic of the Central African Republic , and wanted to be an indication of the Center that the group could stop a group of armed Russian mercenaries in the African country .
The existence of these armed group has not officially confirmed , although many journalism research would point out that the so @-@ called &quot; Wagner &quot; continues to regions like Syria and Eastern Ukraine .
In addition to the group , the group added &quot; Novorossiya &quot; that these allegations have continued to shut down , but is an influential entrepreneur that has been hit with Vladimir Putin and the US because of his alleged intervention in 2016 .

Amnesia .
I am a staunch supporter of the <unk> ; which is far from learning to learn and gather new experiences .
This belief is both the subject of both human beings and intellectual .
So when the opportunity for a temporary scale of a temporary unlicensed non @-@ profit organization ( French NGO ) , I packed my suitcase and made me to Europe .
I wasn &apos;t about the big money made of us , it would be expected , although the salary was expected .
The thing is that no one prepared one is prepared , and it is rare to be written in a institution that is led by a white majority .
He was born in Uganda and mainly in the African region of the Great lakes I had no real idea what would mean .
Even though I was familiar with the <unk> in Africa , a network of the Democratic Republic of Congo , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo , was published in his movie &quot; Kangpe - On the other hand , I had to show the experience , a minority , not made .
Since the revelations of Oxfam in Haiti , international NGO workers have been responsible for sex women for sex paid for sex paid in recent months .
Following the related riots and resulted in a number of other media leaders in international media outlets , Angela Bruce @-@ Taweel , who has found major attention in the media , has been one of the most <unk> <unk> for humanitarian aid in Haiti on 8 America .
Her article &quot; But <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; But wait until they see your black face &quot; ) where they see inclusion and racism , left a deep impression on me .
In addition to the comments of other black women from the sector , the <unk> of social exclusion and social marginalization , where you need to leave it , were completely familiar .
I had an international organizations to explore different marketing organizations , and that the need for the local population to be represented in these organizations .
I had already been talking about the cartoons of ordinary people , as they draw the media .
This new opportunity offered me to create one of the most important challenges in countries in the world - stable migration .
But neither my training in gender questions and <unk> my experiences during a short couple of minutes , and he was able to prepare myself to see this scenario .
Later , I learned that I came to a time where I was demanding a time .
My interrogators sparkle with me and calls for recognition for a national African woman in the team .
A few months later , two weekly staff from Kenya and South Sudan were in the press service that had exclusively been white .
One day , our <unk> was the only one of the only African football team in the <unk> , and called for three African employees .
Perhaps it was the normal way , with the employees in this organization , which was surely the first signs of things that don &apos;t make things <unk> .
Then we exchanged a hilarious smile with the managers and our work back .
This was the first time I was <unk> outside of my skin colour .
By this day , no one of the seniors editors have not been forgotten .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> took me to my <unk> .
I was crying because this African woman escape the war , and their mental health and its clear sense of essentials was required to extend their skills , and all this is only to meet one man like this .
I was crying because I was not complaining about my own , my African colleague , and was convinced it was my duty to protect them from such a <unk> .
The editor &apos;s editor was a white Europeans that had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was &quot; very recommended &quot; to cover the experiences of migrants , and you know what the group is about , &quot; poor Africans , &quot; like I heard about several occasions .
For these men , we were utterly African leaders , not people with communicating with their job .
In order to become a whole of the world , the <unk> situation was with the only white woman in the team .
Because of all that , the woman was working at meetings at meetings .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should participate in a particular meeting I did not know that it was a video that was a lot of work on my desk .
Within 30 minutes , the supervisor was at my door and demanded that I was going to the meeting , and made sure that I didn &apos;t really disagree .
I was surrounded by privileges the White Helmets .
The role that was buried in the racist and <unk> environment was just clear .
She was the one who decided if a contract was achieved , how my co @-@ worker was found on the hard tour .
I can &apos;t count , how often I got calls for ourselves and got a true mine of abuse to me because a single thing was not brought to the table .
And <unk> , when someone made my commitment to <unk> my efforts .
Vaccination <unk> were <unk> .
The supervisor expressed his hostility of female female mutilation - all of whom were - and doesn &apos;t know - and wasn &apos;t even <unk> remarks about these women .
Although most of the students of the Middle East Timor @-@ Leste knew that this man had never been chance to address the topic .
As the work itself was interesting , and I had learnt a price I had to pay a price , I had to pay for ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract at another department but my government demanded that I stayed headed .
The fact that I had had a contract without his release , drove him to his worst behaviour .
I shared a office with another white <unk> who raised all his calls to bypass TV , who started calling for me to express me and make me with all sorts of <unk> .
I learned of others that the plan gave me to <unk> , which I also had to see .
But I had a digital system from the Nothing .
I managed to build workshops with employees in <unk> relationships , even though they used to attend the death of the protest session .
I didn &apos;t all that , as long as I was not aware of the superiors , it was not grateful .
The evident harassment and <unk> led that two colleagues had their job ; a guest in a different department and the other was denied a <unk> , because he was the White Cross of the office .
We tried trying to report these racism and sexism .
Twenty @-@ year @-@ old colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something because &quot; he has good links to the Big Stadium in the <unk> . &quot;
Again , learning was too pointless .
A recent member of the state @-@ based colleague assured me that it would be a consultant to report the events because I would risk a bad motive .
In spite of all of these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave the organization , instead of appropriate employment and justice .
But <unk> , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 percent of all workers in a sector where women are the ones who are affected , and I hope that discussions on # <unk> to promote the scale of racism and abuse in the aid of development aid in development development .
Those responsible need to find solutions for inclusion - not only in the sense , to ensure that there are real guidelines , participatory practices , and opportunities to prevent such acts of violence .

In June 2018 , the Wildlife Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the southern town of June 2018 , where the &apos; jungle of Calais &quot; was home to 10,000 refugees from Afghanistan , Sudan , Syria , Eritrea , Iraq , Iraq and other countries .
With clashes and a intense media coverage , the refugee camp has been destroyed in October 2016 and the ground in October 2016 .
The local authorities decided to make this place to a <unk> , and <unk> it as a &quot; ecological and hygienic object &quot; in the form of a &quot; beautiful flame &quot; on the official website , is growing by a &quot; beautiful flame such as about dogs and the presence of birds , such as <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
However , there are however , however , that the idea of this project is to remove undesirable people from the city , and no damage to protect the territory and fauna .
Benin is nothing more than <unk>
Since the &quot; jungle &quot; shook last year , the French authorities have also been similar projects in other parts of Calais .
According to another <unk> , a small forest cover , which is a community of emergency <unk> , <unk> a park in a park , becoming the effort that forests are increasingly accessible , while parks will be inaccessible .
The official name of the 2.5 hectares of the 2.5 hectares is the &quot; Leme Mendes . &quot;
Every day they will get local organisations with food , water and water supplies .
The forest cover is located between a freeway , a <unk> and a residential area .
This caused the past to other local communities in the past and again , especially in the context of support for refugees , according to Help , local authorities do not pay enough assistance to the refugees .
Mayor Nuno Himmelreich presented a role in the municipal front center on June 12 , 2018 , in front of the municipal front center .
Global Voices participated in the gathering .
However , in this forest @-@ based man , however , we received almost 15 minutes after years ago , when another local leader must be careful to find a solution .
The city &apos;s plans to see that the park is being limited to the park , from a space that is limited to prevent a stop outside of the park , and to prevent cameras to stop the national flag .
According to the Mayor , which aims to identify the owner of dogs who <unk> their business in the park .
In the gathering , numerous other proposals were presented , including the construction of <unk> , a <unk> or <unk> @-@ <unk> .
toilets and <unk> were not mentioned .
The cost of emergency will be paid for the city to 1.5 million euros .
The project is surprising that some elements of major priority are a certain priority as others were planned for August 2018 .

The proposed collapse of the Baram Mendes of the downtown Mendes of smoke in Calais are related to the <unk> of smoke in Calais , where they are sometimes taking place at least the week .
In terms of the new strategy , &quot; no compass &quot; will be used by authorities , using fire , tear gas or tents , tear gas , and blankets .
These actions are usually <unk> at night or dawn , without warning and under a great <unk> .
The refugees are not only taken their housing properly , but also their personal possessions are confiscated , including many cases of police brutality against refugees , including minors .
We will never know what clever Mendes was named after the <unk> of the <unk> , to say that .
In 1988 , Thailand &apos;s Brazilian activist dedicated to his life to fight the struggle for the Amazon forest and the rights of the migrants and indigenous farmers .
With the words of Michel Lyazidi , director of the French National Research Center for Development ( &quot; The jungles of Calais &quot; ) , the <unk> is just a attempt to destroy the past that the &quot; holiday &quot; of the city is just a attempt to dispose of the &quot; holiday of a city &quot; to kill the past .
Many political crises are currently facing many people to see .
The residents of Calais are outraged by the fact that they are treated so bad and the bad picture that is being taught by her city .
It is not exactly about the camp or the migrants , but rather about that there is no solution to the plight of these people .

Some of the time later , she was transferred to the treatment of returning to school , while doctors had to find that their skills for such a medical health care would not be <unk> .

Rape Rape Toll in the camps Â· Global Voices
More than two decades of civil war and famine forced many people to live in Somalia , leaving the homes of returning to homes .
Women and girls living outside of the major cities are mostly affected by sexual assault .
They are vulnerable , and most of rape cases are in the middle or when they collect blockades in remote places .
However , due to the law enforcement , victims are often unable to conduct legal counsel , but it would be necessary to make justice for them .
Homesickhome , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old mother and neighborhood of the Formosa Foundation &apos; camp , was raped by the eyes of her children , who raped her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , they described the attack :
It was midnight when a armed man in a <unk> <unk> in a semi @-@ <unk> <unk> in my apartment was forcibly pulled off outside of the sea .
He did not only bother me , but he was also <unk> me with a heavy wound on my body , which is still a lot of pain .
On the night of the evening , men of the suicide police fired men from the semi @-@ police camp in the compound of Sousse , located in the central city of Maracay .
The men burn fire and twisted some other families .
Both women were raped and must wait for justice for their forced injuries .
However , the attackers were arrested , however , they were charged with a court charged with their crimes .
According to the Human Rights Right Centre , an independent state @-@ based local community in the region , were reported in 2017 .
However , the actual number of rape cases are higher , however , because many victims of the victims don &apos;t file a complaint - afraid of stigma to the lack of crimes and lack of resources .
Apart from the lack of legal health issues , the health system and lack of effective equipment and medical equipment and medical equipment who needed to be needed in this sector is needed to be required .
The public health is not allowed to deal with rape cases .
Domestic culture also cannot be able to accept justice as a economic custom that victims are able to accept or &quot; Camels or livestock &quot; as compensation for the attack :
Rape are ubiquitous and remains in much of frequent locations , as a decades of conflict in a decades of violence and committed institutions to pass the law .
The tradition states that rape victims are an compensation - often camels or animals - accept their attackers as part of a special threat to end the war between rival tribes .
Little steps in the right direction - but it &apos;s enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 , the disputed region ignited the opening of the first analysis of the first analysis of estimates that involves rape cases .
A year earlier , in September 2016 , an anti @-@ corruption law was passed in the country &apos;s first disputed region , which has passed its full support to the bill by 42 members of the bill , which later has officially been officially revoked on a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the federal state of the state @-@ backed state , which also suggested the country &apos;s constitution , also proposed a new anti @-@ corruption bill .
However , it is still a long time until this bill , the second House of the parliament , decided to be passed from the parliament &apos;s second house , decided to be passed and recognized as law .
Although the problem of rape rape has been covered in the past few years and the international community , both sexual violence remains widespread against women and children , and the number of attacks are rising .

Officially , the debate has already started in March - a historic milestone in the long struggle for promoting rights rights in Argentina .
In the coming two months , the deadline for both voters and opponents were honored with both sides .
On the debate the bill was adapted in some counts to win the votes of the votes of the MP .
Among the most important changes is the provision of doctors who reject fines of law enforcement . Hospitals is obligated to have to be required to have donors who agree to be limited .
In addition , women under age 16 are the age of their parents or their favorites .
Meanwhile , online and even another debate has been carried out , since April , various human rights organisations and civil society groups have been focused on the initiative for a legal , secure and free <unk> for green <unk> as a symbol of the Congress .
Their message reads &quot; <unk> , to have a choice ; <unk> to avoid abortion ; legal abortion to prevent deaths . &quot;
At the same time , however , various religious organizations and actors were &quot; Both alive &quot; against the law .
A vigil in front of the Congress was planned for the Congress to enroll in front of the Legislative Council .
Several surveys show that large parts of the country are supporting the bill .
Even journalist Eduardo Muizzu , a brief journalist , posted a brief survey on Twitter , but was somewhat unhappy with the outcome :
&quot; poll : Are you for or legal , legal , safe and gender abortion ? &quot;
The analysis of the Moroccan committee &apos;s analysis of anonymity is also a common majority against legalizing .
In many cases , however , however , the legislators are still not yet to vote , either because the lawmakers are actually not defined or because they are actually not defined by their minds or threats of threats or threats .
The last day of the official debate was a powerful speech from the Ministry of Health Adolfo Ellison of the Ministry of Health Human Rights Ministry Adolfo Geller .
We have been living in a democracy for 35 years .
Abortion is a subject that gets under @-@ hand .
The evidence is clear : a brain marriage has no less mortality and less abortions .
How to take place in any way .
If the draft bill will be adopted , he will put the Senate in which it is a clear majority against the same .
However , this trend could be changing , as the result of the discussion of the discussion in the house direction , where the <unk> members have a key role .

It is impossible to ignore the influence of public opinion in the polls , but also in different personal stories distributed online .
In one of them , a woman is based on the legal and economic obstacles that they faced in abortion .
She doesn &apos;t call the treatment of doctors not in public , but she describes how some refused refused to help her , and how a doctor asks money for money :
My head and my body was still absent .
I felt still the same fear as I take care of the help and distress of medical professionals and the doctors I had had to be given to the creation of the term .
When I was sleeping , I had to be a record of Dr. N. and Dr. B. I have to be looking for Dr. Salvador , especially after I saw him in Congress .
She concludes :
I feel that I have a lot of condemnation in the past few days .
I have a couple of friends who <unk> me as if they keep my hands , I am just one of the many women with a green scarf who looks at the Congress and asks him to vote for the decriminalization .
On Twitter , users have responded to political issues and diverse opinions to favor the bill :
The UN has the criminalization of abortion as a way of life .
If the draft bill will not be adopted , all lawmakers who voted against these torture and the relevant deaths .
They will be every single woman who have <unk> on the conscience .
Abortion is being held , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just involved in rape for legal abortion , if not , they have the <unk> that they were doing , &quot; he says .
Targeted or illegal abortion , this is the question .
If the draft bill is adopted , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America that is the global trend to legalize or sovereignty .
The first country in the region that made this step , was Uruguay &apos;s 2012 .
At the end of the day , the outlook for the South American state in Latin America seemed to be found .
Let &apos;s be the country we want to be .

The others are making the blood of hands and feet .
They make us a sliver of a sliver and help us , and then we are staying in a so beautiful you &apos;re dead , or even beyond death .
For the next three days , the next three days ; every single little detail .
The fourth day will be met and met again on the fourth day , but this is our names not .
It is harder to be in prison .
The days are hard , nights of nights .
And the darkness only only .
Even if you are not tortured , it is not being tortured .
Do they forget us ?
Are we doing the rest of our life here ?
Why did we not sleep today ?
Did they see the phone ?
Questions about questions that you talk about the head .
The day continues .
All days are equal - the stench of blood and <unk> , which <unk> around you all .
You remember each other about the bodies of the other detainees and at the unforgiving walls .
How kind of it feels like it .
The fifth day , until the evening , will be viewed as usual .
The guards opens the door and calls for : &quot; Sarmad , dressing ! &quot; I leave the cell and <unk> my arms face so they could go through the head and lay .
I am <unk> to a space that looks like previous as previous as previous .
&quot; On the knees , I follow the order to leave the order .
The most fascinating conversation will be accompanied by the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> on paper ; another person is now in the room .
You really see very well , more than older than your age , and if you are actually the son of a medical doctor you can only get out of a good home .
Why do you get a gun with you ? &quot;
He starts with a lawsuit for non @-@ authorized detention center in front of the hope that I have at least participated in demonstrations . &quot;
I never had one and I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; a <unk> <unk> from the side and I penetrate through the body .
Well , maybe a third person sits on me and <unk> his knees .
The comuniquÃ© continues : &quot; Listen to , Sarmad , you really can tell us everything .
Even a days of tea .
I want you to believe that you &apos;re not a weapon with you .
But <unk> , you are using us that you will take the demonstration , then we will have to go to the streets , &quot; he says .
&quot; Well , end , will we hear , &quot; he plays a video I am seeing in a demonstration .
We don &apos;t treat anybody .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Tejar , &quot; a thought looked at my head : You always says that Al Zadjali &apos;s teen .
That , however , can &apos;t be <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of his oral .
Now he starts to speak the only language he understood , and <unk> <unk> on me , with just few short <unk> .
He finally came from an hour , so I guess .
Oddly , I return to my cell .
A thing reads is necessary to give me to me .
Since the first interrogation , I have felt as a state of mercenaries in his ban .
With the head and powerful hands , we treat the same way , the same direction is like every morning .
The same German votes cast out of the walls .
I <unk> down my breath , because with my <unk> is not right . &quot; If you can &apos;t stop , &quot; If you don &apos;t stop going to breathe !
Or , if you want to be a lot of time ? &quot; must be done with something else .
I &apos;m all becoming slow and so quietly .
I &apos;m shaking with fear or cold ?
Ah , which makes difference , can &apos;t hear my teeth .
Then I can go home and release you , so you can also release home .
Who filming you ?
How did you manage to send the footage from the TV station ?
Is there something we don &apos;t know ?
I mean , we all know , but I would hear it from your mouth . &quot;
No time for thinking , there are no longer <unk> , the fewer doubts , &quot; I don &apos;t have been filming .
I would have everything and say that I have nothing done .
I think they are good to do this country . &quot;
I &apos;m worried about you ; I &apos;ve become tired of you now .
Listen to me , Sarmad , you are still young and left your future ahead .
We can <unk> all the doors before the nose , but we can open up thousands of doors .
The decision is coming out of you and join this mobile phone here ; you can find yourself on Facebook or in the language , and you tell you to you , and tell me to anyone who will go to this thing . &quot;
In such a moment , there are any single sentence by the head that the other prisoners had said in their <unk> .
The value of your life is closely associated with the people around you .
You &apos;re huddled into machines - who is not allowed to be a case in danger , and who will be sacrificed if there is no other way ?
My mother often spoke of &quot; <unk> you don &apos;t even wish to speak of his actual enemy . &quot;
&quot; I use my e @-@ mail account only for ordinary conversations .
Well , please , I am able to log into me &quot; after several <unk> on my neck , because I used the wrong phone of these situations ( which I &apos;ve got a false account for these situations ) , a third attempt to take a false account of the third attempt .
Violent web websites , online and dozens online forums .
Nothing of him . &quot; Do you know about a fake whistle or what ?
Isn &apos;t it clear about what is &apos; <unk> &apos; what ?
No problem . &quot;
He &apos;s dominance in the eyes , changing me , embracing his views from the table and depends on the room .
In minutes , without someone who is my <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no whip to me live out of the life .
Then the door stops .
He <unk> me in a hijab and starts , <unk> me .
Stay tuned with my feet .
The screams break away from me .
He continues to go back to previous family <unk> water <unk> to me a <unk> cold water .
For hours , for hours , for hours , I can hear how he is a drink he prepared .
She also smells about cigarettes ; there is the room where we are not allowed to be able to do with permission .
I was fed up , and he wants to go through what I can keep on the legs , with no help on the legs .
After several attempts , I am leaving myself back to my cell .
I was immediately buried in powerlessness .
This is just a <unk> of a <unk> system that is supposed to be done to the crime and the editing editing to the criminals .
It is a system that seeks to give us the illusion of freedom - one of the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship because she is the truth .
Sarmad , you can &apos;t sleep all the day you have to go to stand and attract you . &quot; The voice is Abdel Rahman .
Apparently , I had to read the short moment in which he was like to remember the sounds of the next day .
Like all other here , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from <unk> , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smile left no face when he talks with the other .
In the past , he worked in the prison department in Maputo , and he was able to read many books .
In a raid , several banned books were spotted in him - and some pictures he saw as demonstrator .
Those enough to catch him .
The next day some new prisoners come to the following day .
All talk they are talking about a certain degree of performance , &quot; she says . They were shooting to him to arrest him .
And then he got the <unk> with a knife and <unk> the life so much , &quot; one of the <unk> impressed the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> strength .
He continues : &quot; He is big and strong , and he was growing . &quot;
Another few hours , until the name is called the name .
We all checked us all over the hole to catch a closer look at the <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> young man , and he holds tribute to his legs , to see the <unk> destroyed by the bullet destroyed and his neck .
Those guards are afraid of him !
They &apos;re getting <unk> .
We <unk> in Pekanbaru &apos;s silence , everything to hear what it was completely wrong .
Nothing !
We scare us from our routine , <unk> fate <unk> .
Recovered , when they brought him into the barracks .
The time passes without someone there is a word .
It &apos;s all about his previous work , so they really don &apos;t have a choice , but there is no one choice if there is nothing to do with a sit @-@ out or time ?
The door on the <unk> will be <unk> .
The steps of <unk> come closer .
Our cell is open and <unk> .
Then the door again concludes .
We wait until the guards continue and wash <unk> wounds , head to head .
If we are surrounded by some of these distant countries , we are now killed by fires and would be <unk> , but even protected .
But here &apos;s here as a human being you are on the number ; either you get you with her wounds or her .
Within this year &apos;s time , it has been more awareness of awareness , and after some minutes he can stand it .
He takes his hand on the <unk> !
This is more than a window to a grave ; only the guards and its <unk> use him .
None of us were so close to us .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a pretty young man , and I have a lot of women in the nose .
Do it be your sister among them ?
Is you evil on me ?
Or do I know about Mr. ass and you have since been on my blood ?
If you said , we would have been able to take place peacefully .
No reason to make all these anger . &quot;
Laughing <unk> and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of the others , listen to my family .
We knew that we could die .
Then , we chase them before at least one .
Or do you think that these killers are around us only to kill others because we are afraid of them ?
Tiny - they have much more afraid than we before . &quot;
He seemed unaware of that he would hear guards .
Three of them beat the door and Night Wolves in the cell .
They beat them like fierce <unk> and pushed him out .
It should be the last time that I see military <unk> in Iran &apos;s military camp .

Cuba : Activists and artists alike criminalization of Art Â· Global Voices

The main thing that was passed in January this year will be passed in December , December , and therefore therefore regulate activities of the cultural sector , including sale of books .
The controversial regulations provide rules within cultural sector and demand for others to afford the artistic services , with the official institutions .
They are also defined by the demands of the demands of the demands , with the authorities that the authorities have the right to do .
Along with the decree , they can also claim the decree &apos;s use of fines and search for tools , equipment and other possessions that were used for the activity activity .
Also , the artistic event will end with immediate effect .
The controversial nature of the norm is also a requirement in one of the articles , which means &quot; the dignity of the people &quot; hurt .
This is a total of discrimination because of the identity or sexual orientation , and violent images of crime , which would be a complete exception in the cultural territories of Cuba .
Many of the decree &apos;s opponents have appeared to be <unk> in the position of the decree , and reports that these controls will reach the reach of artistic news .
One of the most important arguments is that the ability to <unk> the possibilities of independent artist <unk> , and the door would open the door for strict guidelines and censorship that the government is <unk> .
The petition of the decree showed the charge of the decree , arguing with discussions about a new constitution for the Republic of the Republic in Cuba .
But many are the point of the protests against the decree against the decree .
Amid the discussion of the discussion , a group of intellectuals , artists , and activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s Facebook page , and the pro @-@ government activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , the poet Tawfiq Ming , and the rapper David Onetti , the poet Tawfiq Ming , and the rapper David Williams .
Rosemary and David David also contributed to the project &apos;s launch of <unk> .
The campaign is trying to collect 10,000 signatures ; this is the main system in the Cuban constitution to reach a formal norm .
Meanwhile , a petition and an open letter that were shared on Avaaz has joined the discussions to raise the legitimacy of the norm .
In the text , the signatories show their concern for the art and culture in Cuba over the coming years , if stated that state authorities will carry on who will carry their permission to carry out artistic activity and who will grant them funding :
In the meantime , a crowdfunding crowdfunding program offers a collage of friends with new developments .
The fact that a Cuban artist in the situation is possible to fund its own means of creating its own means - millions of people use new technologies to spread their works on the edge of the world .
It also discussed the risks that are linked to any legal rule in the decree , such as punishment of &quot; Smart content towards ethics and cultural values . &quot;
The open letter is aimed at the president of Cuba , Miguel DÃ­az @-@ <unk> , and has been signed with the new minister of religious religious minister , Miguel Alonso , Coco NuÃ±ez , Coco NuÃ±ez , Coco NuÃ±ez , Coco NuÃ±ez , and Enrique del Macacos .
The concern of the letter will also be shared by the organization Meedia :
Independent artist or those who have no connection with state institutions or groups of civil society are doubly discriminated out against the state of expression and the state &apos;s resources to be seen by the state as a protest .
Moreover , questions related to the norm in religious domains that are taking place in relation to the artistic activity .
This is the case of <unk> de <unk> ( known as <unk> ) , a widespread religion in Cuba , where both dancing and music are part of rituals .
Meanwhile , a hip @-@ hop song depicts the different protests created by artists like David D &apos; <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> based on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and the Standard <unk> by the Band &apos;s Band .
Your censorship is on the closure of concerts that you <unk> .
They &apos;ve always been forced to legalize them .
&quot; You remember the art of art , tell you art
What did you have been in the Constitution sanctions against artists ?
Enough in the repression .
Vinaya Angel HernÃ¡ndez de HernÃ¡ndez de HernÃ¡ndez ( @ miss9afi ) published on the site &apos;s &quot; Del Kozlovsky &quot; Facebook page :
The instant reactions to the decree , the decree &apos;s attitude on the question of a future chaos of censorship and repression ; they are claiming the scope and protection of the financial sources that enable financial sources to provide a role in different levels of the international audience .

But the Brazilian remember that she was once a &quot; dire moment &quot; was called a &quot; dire moment &quot; so protesters said : &quot; the <unk> will be a <unk> for a revolution ? &quot;

It gave me an apology .
&quot; His views are bad for most people . &quot;

Brazilian football fans published a series of explanations , including one of the UESTA Refugee igloo da Juventude , one of the largest and oldest associations that described as the first place :
We and our more than <unk> members realize that it is in a democratic society different online and views .
We are respecting the <unk> as a part of democracy , for our founders .
However , we can &apos;t agree to someone who is opposed to the safety of a democratic person .

I don &apos;t know what they want to achieve for the world .
The most consistent human rights groups and the author Joanna embodied the communities to teach why # <unk> was just a hashtag :
Although nothing can be resolved , there &apos;s no reason why we think differently or other ways to look for our indignation .
In this fight , with hashtags , memes , but also with our bodies - is not just about <unk> .
It is also about how we are talking to politics and be new .

In comparison to her , I am a <unk> . &quot;

It is a part of the economic crisis in Venezuela , which is not spoken by the impact of women and children .
With 44 % of the families in the country where their loved ones are being crying , the women who are sick of the death of their children , are crying to cry the death of their children .
Although the government has been trying to curb the poverty of women in the country , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence are not accused of the government &apos;s independence , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence .
For example , programs of the slums , like Miatta del Barrio ( Women &apos;s mothers and sons of Venezuela ) , has been established in 2011 since 2011 , has been established for a crucial <unk> in extreme poverty since 2011 .
Together both programs between 150 and 350 dollars of the number of children are dependent on the number of children .
On the other hand , abortion in the constitution of Venezuela has been illegal in the constitution of Venezuela as illegal ; a legacy of previous political order of the country that &apos;s otherwise illegal .
Neither ChÃ¡vez and Maduro have opted to Maduro &apos;s mandate in the 20 years .
Abortion is just allowed when life &apos;s life is in danger .
Aglaia Berlutti , known for the Internet and worker of Global Voices , points the beads of <unk> rhetoric towards gender equality :
... in Venezuela , the Cherokee @-@ based feminism is created by the combination of the Environment &apos;s Environment , and particularly @-@ known .
As a result of the politics character of politics , President NicolÃ¡s Maduro identified the validity of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro &apos;s administration , who are fighting in the country &apos;s official account , which continues to continue its identity as a historic interpretation of its identity , as a historic interpretation of its identity .
It has not been resolved to solve existing problems : the acute economic crisis is also dangerous .
According to three local organizations for the persecution of human rights , the rate of femicides is one of the world &apos;s femicides in Venezuela .
There are also various cases of sexual abuse against women driving during the protests in 2017 .
In 2016 , the homicide rate in Venezuela reached over 100,000 people - the highest in South America .
After the annual survey of the United Nations Office of the United Nations Office for Refugees and Television ( IRD ) , who published homicide rates in the world .
The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence ( Telecoms Authority de Violencia ) , which is a different method , showed a single method of 89 , which is a percentage of 89 , in 2017 .
Still , according to the conservationists , there were 40 percent of the crimes in Caracas in July 2018 .
Public crime and violence has increased in recent years , and many women have to have to live the death of their children .
In La MutualitÃ© , in the La MutualitÃ© , a citizen media project <unk> personal media coverage of the crisis , reminds their personal coverage of their two children :
After about half a half hours , they called me to pick me to my children .
My heart was jump from the chest when they saw them and me .
Our <unk> were so unbelievable .
No one has seen this way !
They didn &apos;t have a shirt and no shoes she gave me the wrong message of my life .
The story has repeatedly been repeated : They have taken a child .
Furthermore , the permanent absence of sexual harassment in school , with the lack of access to cancer due to shortage in the country , with the shortage of medicines in the country , in high numbers of occupational pregnancies .
Himalayan Kub , a researcher at the Centre of the National Arts Museum of the Central Bank of Venezuela , explains :
... there is a powerful , small but important but a reminder of mothers in the <unk> is a vicious cycle .
Many of the young people are not being carried out .
They would die after eight months in the hospital , and that survive , moving back into neighborhood , to go back to the neighborhood without support of parents .
Ultimately , the women who leave the country with difficulties .
The number of residents of human trafficking in Latin America and Europe have quadrupled in 2014 and 2018 .
In neighbouring Colombia , more than one million Venezuelans arrived in the past year , the women witnessed prejudice and abuse .
Many of the bloggers who have to &quot; steal &quot; the work of the Venezuelan migrants , they are considered to &quot; steal &quot; and crime .
To make up with this fake ideas , the feminist channel Las Basics has produced an article in the Colombian Ministry of Colombia on YouTube .

The armed gangs appear in comparison to previous attacks since May , compared to previous attacks .
What the first thing is , it &apos;s against attacks on public and commercial institutions .
In the past two months there was too Protective <unk> , with machetes .
It concerns the population and the government that no one has been known to these attacks .
The <unk> , the nature of the military education and the real types are not clear - but there are some suspects .
It is not because of belief - it &apos;s because of money

A study conducted by the Institute of Social Rights ( ONEMI for Civil Rights ) , published on May 22 , shows that it was a group that highlights its goals in Cabo Delgado and its goals as well as the Islamic Empire &apos;s goals in Cabo Delgado and its goals as the Islamic Federation .
Between November 2017 , February 2017 and February 2018 , three trips to Cabo Delgado , including religious leaders and families of youth who are part of the young groups and families .
Concern &apos;s conclusions indicate that the group was originally known as a conscript @-@ known , a Arab term called &quot; supporters of the most Outrageous tradition and the baboon &quot; , which means &quot; supporters of the most Outrageous tradition and the judiciary &quot; system .
From 2015 , the movement began to integrate military cells .
The study according to the study , members of the Republic of Republic of the Republic of Mozambique ( Zamtel ) , are trained by focusing on gender practices and attitudes from Tanzania and other countries in the region about the Great lakes .
The group is supposed to learn from socially marginalized and not education .
Although they had religious origins and propaganda <unk> , the occupation of the alleged traditional values of Islam , they had the occupation of Cabo Delgado and the establishment of an Islamic state in the north of the country &apos;s north .
This kind of killer has been confirmed by police arrested .
People were ordered to have <unk> to the group , after they promised to be <unk> after the commissions .
The study also shows that the aim is to create illegal <unk> in the region , including wood wood , <unk> , upstream , palm and salt .
The investigator explained that the group is conducting illegal 50,000 revenue per week , which means for the state of 3 million US dollars in the same period .
The start of the &quot; Operation Defensive Edge &quot; by the central government in 2017 , has contributed to the illegal trade of the group , and perhaps the <unk> of the group .
This is also believed to be a part of the insurgents in the southern region of Chicherta , in the south of Qassim , located in the southern province of Ait 13th , where they were declared illegal , before they reached the <unk> budget , given the <unk> of the electoral agency in 2012 .
In February 2017 the government ordered security forces , all illegal weapons that remained in the area , Argentina .
But we have been covering reports of torture by the military in the local press , which has led to a criminal investigation , which has remained no end .
The <unk> characteristic of <unk> <unk> is a society that exists from the English @-@ language community , which is the 75 % of the country , and a political party that ruled the country since independence of 1975 , a political party that ruled the country since independence .
Samora Machel , son of the chief of Culture and Public President Samora Machel is the president of the country &apos;s president .
In just a single one , 2018 took place in Singapore , led by the <unk> of $ 1.15 million of $ 1 million .
For the study of the study , the recruitment of the recruitment of the region is causing the recruitment of financial conditions in the region and the lack of basic social institutions in the region .
According to data from 2016 , the province revives 13 million inhabitants from the year of 2016 , 94 percent of them are unemployed , from 24 % of the age of 15 , 24 % between 15 @-@ 24 years .
Terror and escape
The Mozambican researcher of Human Rights Watch , 64 Machado , visited one of the injured places .
From this woman and hundreds of their neighbors , the houses in decaying Transnistria , located in the northern province of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique , was destroyed only a night in a terror center .
She stayed for nowhere to go .
When I tried to talk with her , she asked me : &quot; Why , why , why , why .
The villages are living in areas without access to electricity , <unk> , <unk> and grass , which are affected by air fires .
If women and children leave them , they only have a few <unk> and small animals .
Given the situation of fear and uncertainty , the government of Cabo Delgado has decided to stop public shipping shipping and equipment in the night , while the United States , England and Portugal have staged travel to the province .
Rebuilding Malawi is on alert .

Leif Heimfarth is a young activist and Computer engineer engineer , which featured on Facebook with &quot; <unk> a protocol for sexual diversity in Cuba , &quot; which has almost 150 members of the group in Cuba .
Oddly , his work began as a activist for his experiences as human rights advocates and human rights advocates for the National Center for Forest Policy ( UCAB .
For two years , he elaborated on the University of Computer Science Science in Havana , which is dedicated to preserve sexual health and rights , &quot; Love at a Second Generation &quot; ( love to the second look ) .
In 2014 , he was able to join Latin America and the Caribbean in the 6th regional Summit of the International Lesbian Committee , Gay enthusiasm , weekly and Hebrew Association ( KTB , Global Voices ) , of course , was a transgender and transgender Association .
Currently , he is a member of the Egyptian Nobel Romero Romero Center , where he works with young people who works with social equality .
Finally , the recent debate in Cuba is the current debate in Cuba for anyone who is not recognized by the constitution .
In our conversation , many interesting aspects of the debate was discussed by the level of meaning for the people of marriage , gay rights , transgender , transgender , transgender , bisexual and intersex ( non @-@ economic communities ) communities to regulate the basic lives of citizens .
Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should people be able to legalize their relationship in Cuba in your opinion ?
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think it should be a legal mechanism for it .
Most of the most important events , including those with the environmental expansion of environmental property , is worried that the relationship is recognised and law .
Like this , like this , it &apos;s marriage for all , <unk> or anything else , will depend on what our revolutionaries take place and to overcome our ability to overcome us .
In the international level , there are several countries where it is part of their justice .
We do not have the first step in Cuba .
I personally don &apos;t think a legally @-@ term contract that would guarantee the emotional stability of a relationship , but he can help to protect the heritage of danger and <unk> .
The expansion of the legal law , the right @-@ wing couples to adoption .
It &apos;s a topic where only a few people speak in Cuba .
It is complicated and not free of ethical questions .
GV : Do you think a national referendum will be necessary to determine whether better partnerships between the same gender / <unk> in Cuba should be allowed ?
Rykov : I personally think that the right of people should not be accused of deadly statements , not even those .
However , there are some legal events that can &apos;t be left from eight .
For example , marriage is defined in the Cuban Constitution ( Article 36 ) as &quot; A volunteer Telecommunications Group between a man and a woman who can be seen legally to live live . &quot;
The video shows common communities .
Some important revisions can be introduced here as a recognition in the recognition of the recognition of a formal marriage , without a formal marriage .
This second option seems to be the easiest , but it has limited access to reach .
If they are able to accomplish money , marriage would still be a gay right / privilege for couples of different gender equality during same @-@ sex community or <unk> community , that would have to highlight discrimination .
However , I should understand that a communications connection between people of the same sex is only one point in the agenda of sexual diversity .
That &apos;s why I should think the point of all legal initiative will be discussed , and the agenda will be seen as such as activists and organizations .
Regardless of equality in marriage , <unk> said :
I think <unk> is <unk> .
By the story , marriage is a tool to legalize the <unk> , <unk> and the Jewish @-@ Christian standards .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give a chance , but I think the debate did not reach the <unk> that they should have .
That &apos;s why I would like to address questions about future debates in the room :
Why is marriage equality in such a lot of headlines ?
What place should they take place in the Agenda &apos;s Agenda ?
Does it make sense to fight marriage , just because the right ?
What is the real blow to this legal mechanism ?
If we speak about the recognition of relationships by African couples , this is the only connection between two people ?
What happened to the <unk> relationships ?
Should their suggestions come from <unk> ?
What will affect the marriage marriage system for trans people , which has access to medicine and <unk> priority ?
Will the marriage change change for a lesbian woman supporting a fellow of an Ethiopian woman in Cuba ?
Because the <unk> of the Ministry of Public health is not sufficient for heterosexual couples , it wouldn &apos;t be a requirement that must be a couple of <unk> .
GV : Do you know a case or a foreign scientist in Cuba where people who learned not to be recognized by the recognized role ?
abcnoman011 : I are many cases .
One of this is a friend of a friend that was founded after his partner of his partner partner .
It &apos;s a <unk> story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased was pushed out from the house .
After his death , the father almost received all his possessions of his son .
Since the community was not recognized , there was almost no legal situation .
Moreover , there are widespread <unk> ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) , and more places for couples that are poor @-@ sex couples .
GV : Last four years ago , a commenter named assembled MartÃ­nez HernÃ¡ndez , under an article published by the newspaper <unk> ( CCP , the Chinese Communist Party ) , is the following comment : &quot; Marriage for All of us , disrespectful , and it would be as much as recognition of treaties between people and animals .
It should not be legal because it is not normal .
There are couples who spend their entire lives without married to the decriminalization of something that is not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer this way ?
Note : To all this , I want the comment that the comment you object , was motivated by an article which appeared on May 6 , 2014 .
In an article published by journalist Suzgo University , a journalist at the beginning of the International Lesbian Committee , Gay wrote of previous times , personally personally , personally <unk> .
Mother comment reflects the personal perspectives of someone who is open to all the marriage .
It &apos;s his opinion , and I respect it but that &apos;s a great ignorance of the matter .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is so rare , how the Misdemeanors Cathedral itself is .
What is normal and of course , it &apos;s not well for the other may and vice versa .
For this , it &apos;s a long time about the truth .
During the time of slavery , the purpose of a person became a &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; of course , something what &apos;s the punishable of the punishable .
If there is one thing I am very convinced I am very convinced that the love we are gay people , as the love that we are in love , are the love of people to explain each other .

The next 48 hours are crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court demanded the government in an unprecedented verdict , citing Colombian lawyers in the country , and the return of his work to the United Nations Commission for the International Commission of the International Commission against impunity in Guatemala ( suspected <unk> la <unk> en Guatemala ) on the basis .
In recent month , Guatemala &apos;s President Jimmy Morales announced the mandate of the mandate of the equation and <unk> , who is currently in the United States , is returning to Guatemala &apos;s return to Guatemala .
The decision has sparked both national and international outrage and resulted in an international outcry and protests of conflict .
Earlier , the Commission of Morales and members of his family accused corruption of his family in the space , which obligates Morales , and his subscribers has now been responsible for which the Constitutional Court is responsible for the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not just a test to the democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors of the president who supported the president in the past .
According to a official statement , Morales could require the approval of a ban on the approval of the country &apos;s approval to be issued .
Journalists such as Nina Karua and other commenters on social media shows the current situation , and the various degrading scenarios , especially if Morales should be requested to support the ruling year and support the army :
Guatemala : The Court of Constitutional Court is final .
Unfortunately , in the sense of the constitution , it is not possible to ignore the ruling that @ <unk> against President @ <unk> &apos;s president .
What will he do and do the leaders of the leaders ?
Does the constitution be able to fail or <unk> a coup ?
Human rights activists , including the arrival of human rights groups , have reacted with relief and confidence , but also with concerns about the government &apos;s next steps :
Reliable news of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It had to be done .
The respectable Constitutional Court is making public order again .
What could happen next 48 hours to return to Guatemala &apos;s next 48 hours ?
A political blow ?
In the past few months in Guatemala , the political turmoil against corruption and the political turmoil in Guatemala have played a very special significance .
This is how the political rise of Morales , after a human rights movement , and impunity that have formed large parts of the political class , and the regime of then President Otto PÃ©rez Molina .
In the political crisis , the Commission &apos;s presence and its investigation was expected to be an important role in the country &apos;s political crisis .
Now , where Morales are in the midst of political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment in Guatemala &apos;s protection to protect its democratic institutions in the protection of its democratic institutions .
Salvadoran journalist HÃ©ctor Silva highlighted thesis on the significance between Morales - and Morales &apos; President &apos; :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala with a support of <unk> groups , including some links with links to military news site .
When he took office , he said he was neither an thief or a thief .
Today he is a president who <unk> by <unk> power to prevent him that corruption will be investigated against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # MozQuerPaz ( resignation of &quot; resignation &quot; ) , which was used in 2015 , has hosted new followers and protests in the street .
At the same time , international media in the region have highlighted international media from the region as the Colombian newspaper El PaÃ­s in the region and called the international community to track further developments in the country :
Regardless of the <unk> changes , the situation continues to take place in the midst of the country , and that <unk> is a thorn in a thorn in the matter , without even trying to stay with the issue of journalism .
Therefore , the international community has to protect the people of Guatemala to protect its institutions and search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be on Guatemala &apos;s claims in its <unk> in its <unk> , which could result in the outcome of a similar impact on the history of a similar scale .
Is this the last <unk> <unk> in <unk> ?

In the hills of the northern <unk> in western India , the community of solidarity is a peaceful and difficult life .
From the hills , the Echo of songs filling the songs for each work .
They are not average villagers , the decades of staying in the same place , and a astronomical revenue .
They are more respectful , like their name suggests , &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> and can roughly roughly be translated by &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of the <unk> . &quot;
However , during the past generations , however , there are a return to a debt that could be lost in <unk> <unk> in <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk> saw many challenges such as climate change , economic infrastructure , and the physical infrastructure of a police officer in a city .
Since the 1960s , when closed borders closed in the 1960s , these challenges have increased .
The lives of a <unk> race is a key fight , with the result that the number of people who are willing to take on traditional life constantly yields .
A year ago , the annual stream of Tibet , where she was originally <unk> in the northern areas of Sikkim to <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
During the spirit of the <unk> , they fired temporarily near heavy shelters in Tibet where the grass was longer and <unk> , and not through the weight of the sugar mill .
In the summer , they moved towards south in the northern region of Sikkim , and remained some time in areas such as golf , <unk> , <unk> and laughter .
There were bosses of the laughter of the laughter valley with the <unk> that is not only economically , but also culturally for both sides .
The trade was to cultural exchange and struggle for the two communities .
In exchange , the <unk> surrounding the livestock and sold , which remained the norm , headed to their own , rose <unk> community with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This exchange of agreement between Tibet and India has been relieved , as well as through the open borders that belonged to the non @-@ immigration organization , without <unk> .
Following the occupation occupation of China , the border was closed and the <unk> were forced to relocate one of the two sides .
Since then , the film has been restricted to a region , both in winter and in the summer .
Dr. Anna Pesquera , Senior Manager at the Graduate Institute of Forest Affairs in Sikkim , told that the Prosecutor &apos;s Office is the claim that the group &apos;s claims that there was about 1,000 lashes in front of the park , which had a re @-@ year anniversary of the origin of the origin of the film .
Currently , there are fewer than 12 families that lead to the traditional lives of the <unk> .
Other members of the community have found multiple jobs and most of them attempted to relocate in smaller towns .

Because of all odds , everyone stood together
The traditional way of transportation is not easy .
Using their territory in the state of Sikkim , they are exposed to the state of Sikkim , they are facing more heavy snowfall in the northern areas of Mindanao , due to more heavy snowfall in the green waters of the <unk> .
&quot; If it &apos;s snow , it is very difficult for the animals like us for the animals such as for us , &quot; says Onyando <unk> in a Film institute called &quot; Manual Introductorio on the border with the title of Northern Congo . &quot;
They rely on <unk> on <unk> , but heat is growing in a problem .
According to Frommer &apos;s average temperature , the average temperature in Sikkim is increasing around 2.5 degrees .
This has led to a <unk> of <unk> , and the heat is preparing for the benefit of people to care .
The <unk> animals will be forced to be a exposure and the <unk> are forced to sell them either or give them <unk> <unk> because the grass in winter is covered with snow .
This means a additional place to buy the <unk> .
This is a relatively new community for the traditional community of travelling with goods that are based on their daily demand for goods and their offerings .
Since the procedure , the community has to leave the army as well as they can &apos;t afford to find medical aid at medical aid , even though the army can &apos;t afford to afford with poorer diseases .
In such cases , the simple survival is sensitive .
To understand the problem , you have to find out that <unk> is a central role in the community of ways they can deliver and add milk and milk to add to different products , and they will add milk and milk .
From <unk> things are things like <unk> , clothing and <unk> .
In previous times , more expensive vendors were also identified , <unk> and <unk> , from <unk> <unk> , which were mainly represented in Tibet and served as a <unk> .
The majority of the struggle has been suspended .
In the winter of winter , the milk genre for tea is known for tea - in the neighborhood of Chai , and in the summer of the summer , in the summer and the summer of summer .
With a rare farm , one of which was typically sold in place , which is now sold in place , where a businessman has now been a rare one .
For all these years , however , the mistress will still be seen as guests and not as residents of the area .
They are trapped and must be <unk> , not only because they are able to attract each other because they are able to add the rules and regulations of the LGBTI communities .
A uncertain future for the profession of the Environment
Yet , despite all this backdrop , some <unk> a living is a living of a living living .
They <unk> the gaps that they hold over <unk> of <unk> villages in laughter and <unk> for the army .
In addition to <unk> , clothes , food , and other parts of the world , have to bear the cost of their children in the expense of their children , when they decided to send their children to schools in schools .
After their education and urban life , the children are being used to return to the children and <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , &quot; If everything else , life is the life of the last way , &quot; says Dr. Anna Kanafy .
Young men have also come back to work as a result of their work because they would not find any bride .
Those who divide the profession of the <unk> , are mostly part of the army , the government or other urban jobs .
With the recent rise in tourism in <unk> in <unk> , jobs are also asked in this sector .
Those who don &apos;t find their jobs in the Tibetan &apos;yÅshÅ« .
Neither the government &apos;s responsibilities is still supporting the interest of some of the less @-@ non @-@ profit organizations for the young people to continue the traditional way of life .
Despite all this , there are those who take care of the traditional work of <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But even they are aware that their children would decide to sell the livestock to sell their livestock in cities and take other jobs .
This a generation could easily be the last chapter in <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .

Ali Qatifaan was 21 years old when he arrived in July 2013 as a <unk> to Australia from a boat to Australia .
After 6 months , he was transferred to the island @-@ based refugee camps in Papua of Australia , foreign refugee camps in Papua @-@ Guinea , where he should spend the next four years of his life .
On Thursay , he began to draw cartoons about cartoons to overcome his <unk> , making the situation and other asylum seekers .
He took the <unk> of &quot; Fish Fish &quot; ( skinned fish ) , who has pop up at a high seas in 2013 .
After almost three years of imprisonment , the media started to publish its cartoons , the cartoons of the refugees on Manus .
Some of the cartoons also reveal their health and sexual abuse that he had learned in the camp .
In 2016 , he was awarded his work by the Inter @-@ European Network International Rights Network ( The International Network for Conservation of Women &apos;s Rights ) Award in 2009 .
The reason for his award is : &quot; His cartoons will be seen as a day from <unk> of the worst human behavior of the worst human behavior since the World War II . &quot;
Australia is being criticised from the world due to the situation in the refugee camps .
The United Nations has the most political line in the prison @-@ torn detention center in the underground camp to &quot; combine , inhumane and degrading punishment . &quot;
Ali was released in December 2017 after a global campaign for his release .
On 17 December , he reached military support in Norway by the support of the International Cities of Slovyansk Network .
On e @-@ mail , we interviewed Ali nearly a year after he has been called &quot; a exit in freedom . &quot;
He talked about his life after his arrest , experiences in the refugee camp , and shared advice for other artists who are persecuted for others .
Ali knew that even though he is happy with his new life in Norway , it was very difficult for it to adapt .
After two weeks , I fell into a deep depression , which was even more than five months , until it was done with the help of a psychologists and a few friends .
He remembered his decision to understand cartoons from a medical employee after he ordered an medical employee to shut down his <unk> , but even though it wasn &apos;t easy - with other things , the detainees didn &apos;t have access to paper and pen .
I was fed up until 2014 , and I had no sufficient paper , and I had to find enough paper papers , and I had to find a lot of paper , and I had to find a lot of years until I was able to build my writings on someone .
And this was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The art didn &apos;t help me <unk> <unk> , but it has helped me to help my voice to people outside the world outside the camp .
It was the art that saved me , my life was saved my life .
His paintings brought their attention to the attention of medical rescuers and the <unk> machine on the first hand , then on Manus .
Later , Australian media have been reporting on his art to his art in the aftermath of the tribunal :

This is Ali &apos;s prayer to identify artists , especially young artists who are subjected to crackdown :
Don &apos;t stop stop what you do .
Stay tuned , keep cartoons , send your voice in the world .
It takes his time , it takes place , but it &apos;s work .
No action .
I asked for help for help I &apos;ve asked for help .
I have given my freedom after a number of people asked for help after I asked .
To ask help is not shameful .
He also asks that groups who offer refugees to take care of the refugees in the camp to give false information about the situation in the camp .
The truth has helped me .
The truth helped me to get back my freedom .
It took long , but it didn &apos;t work
