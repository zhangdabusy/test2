In different places , particularly in West Africa , migration has called &quot; bug @-@ known &quot; as summarized in the region .
There is a normal strategy of migration as a normal strategy to find work in the country or in neighbouring countries - or the most common type of migration , especially in West Africa , or whether you are in the country - or if you are in the neighboring countries .
Europe is not always the goal of the migration .

These travel often didn &apos;t have any place .
One time there is a time to stay in place to work and earn money .
After that , you &apos;re traveling and remains in another place for some time .
Or you &apos;ll be deported from the country .
The whole thing is more and more noise than the <unk> way to Europe when he is often represented .
Without work and opportunities in their husbands , it will be considered the decision to leave home and seek to better better better .
Just as a young person , just a choice of dignity , is also a decision of dignity . &quot; They hope to do what a person responsible for the responsible person responsible for their family .
And by young people , they are expected to take care of their parents and other family members . &quot;
Justice agrees : &quot; It is about to improve the situation at home .
Between the youth in Mali , narratives that have been to do something about his country .
There is a basic sense that the political system of the youth will help . &quot;
For these young people , they can meet what will be expected and they can take their oath as adults outside of their country .
As long as the situation is not change in their home , the young people will make their way to other locations .
&quot; It &apos;s OK , &quot; who says ?
In the words &quot; It will be OK &quot; encourages young Guineans to stay in their country .
But who can , do they protect the situation , guarantee that the current situation will be okay ?
Like many other campaigns of the EU , the video has only <unk> the accent to the migration and mentioned opportunities that young people in their homeland are not explicitly explicitly .
The idea is : &quot; If they want to address the message at home , they would have some of the options that are there . &quot;

The road was long and <unk> .

Moreover , the National Assembly of the National Assembly ( ANC ) - the president of the National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) had taken place in front of the National Assembly of National Constituent Assembly - a controversial law that has called &quot; hatred &quot; or removed .
You consider that people have been arrested due to tweets because of tweets , it seems that the regulation has already been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has been causing a growing shortage of goods and basic services , such as paper , electricity and <unk> .
The shortage in connection with political policy has undermined public access to information and news , has generated a tense and strong state situation for communication and information .
Newspapers go online ... and will then be blocked
With the rapid rise from <unk> and only hard of paper &apos;s work , local newspapers ( especially popular newspapers ) were forced to keep up to their expenses , or to keep their attention online , or <unk> online .
In the beginning , a journalist tweeted :
It is reported that the El Defense University has been blocked in various parts of Venezuela .
Today , I observed that on my computer in El Paso , La Linea , and other Venezuelan websites that have been blocked for the dictatorship &quot; Yuka . &quot;
And others also the problem ?
Mobile strike reports .
Months later , journalists reported on Twitter and other media outlets that El Socialist , one of the country &apos;s most important newspapers :
It &apos;s done with El servers on the server :
&quot; It &apos;s unclear , &quot; it &apos;s about banning
Galya , a organization who defended free expression and access to information , has defended the Internet &apos;s service , and has been blocked on their Twitter account , which has blocked websites of sexual content such as OnlinePetition.ru and <unk> .
The measure has drawn the attention of the public and the media in both and abroad .
Rara Maldivians , who do what the authoritarian views for morality and decency have made them :
The question that needs to be included here is how it could come .
Everyone would say that Chavism is a regime that Chavism is still a regime but is still safe in all sectors of society .
Those who try to make him go to the way to make a complete rule of society .
Other users were quick to analyze the real reach of the measure and their close connection with Internet censorship - a recent concern not only in Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main block is not only the blocking of results , which is already a disaster , but that the blocking will also spread to other sites .
What will you stop blocking sites ?
They will be the blocking of other sites that will be next .
Still , other users suspect that it is not to be <unk> to censorship .
The broadband Internet and the control of it for the actual problem :
Titicaca &apos;s block &apos;s block is neither <unk> , nor it has been built because the government wants to protect children .
The reason for this is that Venezuela has no money to pay the difference that provide access to Internet access to Internet access .
What alternatives are there ?
Perhaps Tor can help ... or not
Tor is a free tool that will be used online to browse online , allowing many to use Internet access , and Tor has been blocked online .
The ban on the Tor network seems to appear on the Tor network , therefore , is not entirely effective .
Yet organizations like Acceso Libre or Maan Sin Okwonga was confirmed that Tor was blocked .
They beat solutions to the limitations :
We can confirm that Tor ( direct link ) is blocked , @ <unk> , you can use it with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
It will be reported about the ban on @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To bypass censorship , we can use bridges and Tor :
When you look at the context and history , it sees the projection of freedom of expression and access to information .
Many Venezuelans are asking what media or <unk> will be censored as next , and what can be done to be done by the government &apos;s actions .

Is it more efficient and voter reports on the site of the forum to determine the following stage ?

In addition to the reduction of the failure , there is at least the &quot; creation of work &quot; because of course , at least the supporters of the staff .

Djemal , self @-@ determination , who was planning to elaborate in the Central African Republic in the Central African Republic , wanted to be an indication of a hint of formal Russian political prisoners in the African country .
The existence of this armed group has not been officially confirmed , though numerous journalism research pointed out that the so @-@ called &quot; Wagner group &quot; in trouble such as Syria and Eastern Ukraine .
The group , according to the group , would have to enforce the group rather than again , with a powerful entrepreneur who has been given ties to Vladimir Putin and the US for his alleged reign in the US presidential elections in 2016 .
The conviction of a group of interest , civic and university graduate , is high among her colleagues and colleagues .

I am a staunch supporter of the voiceless ; that is far from his Middle East , to learn and gather new experiences .
This belief is both responsible for both migration and intellectual .
So , as the opportunity for a recent international non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ profit organization .
I didn &apos;t have the big money that was always told us , but it would be expected even though the salary was <unk> .
The lack of no one is prepared , and on the rarely @-@ depth report , what it means that it is a institution that is led by a white majority .
He was in Uganda and mainly in the African region of the huge lakes of the huge lakes , I had no real idea what it would mean .
Although I have been familiar with the <unk> in Africa in Africa , it &apos;s also the chance to be the Mexican Republic of Congo , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo in his movie &quot; Puede - <unk> <unk> On &quot; the experience , I had the experience to be a minority .

Her post &quot; But let &apos;s wait to see your <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; but Want to Stop Your black face &quot; ) , where they use inclusion and racism in the <unk> , the very striking and <unk> for me .
The comments of other black women from the sector are also different from the sector and the social exclusion that you have to be exposed to survive , too .
I had international organizations to provide different obstacles to different organisations and knew the need for the local population to be represented in these organizations .
I already had very excited about the cartoons of ordinary people like expressing the media .
In addition , this new opportunity provided me to one of the most major challenges for countries around the world - migration migration .
But neither my education in gender in gender @-@ based questions , and even my experience in a short strike was prepared to prepare on this scenario .
Later , I learned that I came to a time in the variety of diversity ( rather than inclusion ) .
My pocket bragged sat with me and sought recognition for an independent African woman in the team .
A few months later , two of the travelers from Kenya and South Sudan arrived in the press service , where there were only no White bullet .
One day , our <unk> took our <unk> to the only African <unk> in the classroom , and called us three African staff staff .
Perhaps the normal way that the workers were able to collect points on this organization , and it was still the first signs that things were not <unk> .
We exchanged a <unk> smile with the managers and returned to our work .
That was the first time I was <unk> because of my skin &apos;s skin .
By this day , no one had to let me go from the superiors .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> changed my door and cry .
I was crying because these African woman escape the war , and their serious health and clear beliefs , she was reunited with a Masters to develop their skills , and all the only way to meet a man like this .
I was crying because I didn &apos;t take it through me , my African colleague , who was convinced that it was my duty to protect them from such a <unk> .
The association was a white Europeans that never had in Africa or the Arab world for &quot; very trivial &quot; to report about the experiences of migrants , and you know what group is entitled &quot; poor Africans &quot; : &quot; poor Africans , &quot; and you know what group heard about different opportunities .
For these men , we were utterly distressed with the people who deserved their jobs to right .
In order to come out there , the most passive situation with the only white woman .
Because of all this woman , what this woman was taking to meetings against meetings .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should participate in a certain event , which I wasn &apos;t found it because it was a lot of work on my desk .
Over the next 30 minutes , the producer ran in my door and demanded that I go to the meeting , and I realized that this woman would not seem to respond .
I was surrounded by the shame of the White Helmets .
The role that this white woman was in the racist and <unk> environment was just too clear .
She was the one who decided that the contract was extended from Kenya to the hard tour .
I can &apos;t count as many calls I have received a real reality in terrorism on me , and a real reality for abuse of the day , because a single thing was not to end .
And <unk> when someone from another branch of my efforts praised my efforts .
They were <unk> .
The supervisor expressed his hostility raised by members of the guards - those who know all of those who were knows - and also doesn &apos;t provide praise with remarks about these women .
Although most of the colleagues of the middle @-@ community community knew that the man had <unk> , there was never opportunity to address the issue .
As the work itself was interesting , I had learned to pay a long price , I had to pay with ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract with another branch , but my <unk> ordered me to go to him .
The fact that I received a contract without his <unk> , moving to his worst behaviour .
I shared a office with a different white <unk> , which all his calls to call out his calls to how to call for me to express myself and say with all possible <unk> .
I heard from others that the plan was to push me to leave what I have always found .
But I had built a digital system from the Nothing .
I managed to build with employees in <unk> relationships , although it began to build in the mention of the press station .
But all that did not have happened to the superiors as long as I did not dwell on the superiors .
The apparent harassment and Sandblast led to the fact that two colleagues leave their jobs ; a police member and others were denied a legal camera because he was the white BBC director .
We tried to report these racism and sexism .
Reputable high colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something because &quot; he has good links to the Big dress in the country . &quot;
It also was too pointless to study .
Even a recent colleague from the tournament told me that it would be as a consultant to report the events because I would risk a poor state .
Given all of these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave the organization for a year to leave the organization , for a year .
But <unk> , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 percent of the labor sector in a sector where women are the ones affected by those affected , and I hope that discussions about # <unk> will help raise awareness of racism and abuse .
Officials need solutions to make solutions to inclusion and women in <unk> , but ensure that it is real policies to stop sexual attitudes and opportunities to prevent such abuses .

It leads to this point of view of the long @-@ size highway and factories that looks at the city &apos;s development industry , which looks at a more <unk> landscape .
In June , the Wildlife Sanctuary , which was set ablaze in the city city of June , hosted on that tiny land in June , where the so @-@ called &quot; jungle of Calais &quot; was living in the city of Afghanistan , Syria , Syria , Eritrea , Iraq and other countries .
With treatment of confrontations and a intense media coverage , the camps were completely destroyed in October , 2016 , and the ground was completely destroyed , including restaurants , shops , shops , shops , a mosque , and a church .
The local authorities decided to make the place a <unk> , and <unk> it as an &quot; ecological and <unk> theme &quot; to read it as an &quot; ecological and <unk> theme &quot; in the official website , calling for a &quot; beautiful vegetation , and the presence of birds and the presence of birds , for example . &quot;
However , there is also speculation that the project &apos;s decision is to remove undesirable people from the city , and not the flora and fauna of the plant .
No other than <unk>
Since the &quot; jungle &quot; since the &quot; jungle was since &quot; gained similar projects in other parts of Calais .
As aimed at another <unk> of <unk> , a small <unk> of <unk> is living in a park to turn into a park ; it will be the intention that forests are still accessible to the forests , while parks could be closed .
The official name of the Whole hectares of large hectares of forest <unk> is &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; which gave him the term &quot; Mexican forest . &quot;
Every day they are coming from local organizations with food , water and supplies supplies .
The cover is located between a highway , a <unk> and a residential area .
Led by other local communities in the past , and in the context of heightened tensions , the majority of refugees have been unable to offer the refugees unable to help refugees not get ready to pay out .

Many political crises are currently being forced to see many people .

Turkish radio station reports :
During the midst of the botched school , it was supposed to be targeted by a rental rental company , he tried to rape , but she struggled to rape , but she struggled with strong resistance against her attacker .
When the soldier , which was identified as a <unk> @-@ known anti @-@ war @-@ old , he shot that he would not reach her to the <unk> , she shot in the <unk> .
A few time later , she was transferred to the treatment of doctors , but the medical doctors had to accept that their skills for such an unnecessary health care would not have required .
This is not alone , not alone .

rape rape in the camps for the IDPs
More than two decades of civil war and famine forced many people in Somalia to leave home and live in courts .
Women and girls who live in camps outside the major cities are being targeted by sexual assault .
They are vulnerable to , and most rape are used in the middle of the night or when they collect them from remote places .
At the same time , victims often have no way to have a legal framework , but it would be necessary to raise justice for them .
Homesickhome , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old single mother and rock resident of Rage slaughtered @-@ camp , was raped before the eyes of her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , she described the attack :
It was midnight when an armed man arrived in a semi @-@ <unk> cake mine in my <unk> , surrounded me and raped .
He did not only raped me , but I looked at me with a severe wound of my body , which is still very much pain today .
At the night of the barricade , men came out of the cold police in the semi @-@ district camp in the semi @-@ district camp in the central city of Maracay .
The men <unk> on tents and rapidly beat water and a lot of mother .
Both women were raped and must continue to wait for justice for their missiles .
They arrested the attackers , but they were neither charged with a court for crimes .
According to Human Rights Right , an independent state of the region in 2017 , 80 rape cases have reported in the South African region .
However , the actual number of rape rape is higher in fact , as many victims have no notice - from fear of stigma , <unk> trust in the <unk> and lack of access to necessary health facilities .
Aside from the problems of prosecution , the physical health system and lack of new <unk> and lack of online equipment and medical equipment in this sector needs to be another obstacle to survivors of sexual assault .
Health health centers also have no lack of doctors to deal with rape cases .
The indigenous culture can be found on the way , as a local custom would require victims of their attackers or &quot; camels or animals &quot; as compensation for the attack :
Rape are present , and remains all over @-@ 4,000 people , as far as there has been a country &apos;s climate of violence , and has weak to investigate the law .
The tradition states that rape is compensation - often sewage or livestock - accept their attackers in the midst of a rival practice that aims to end the war between rival tribes .
Little steps in the right direction - but is it enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 the region &apos;s most active region took place with the launch of the first forensic laboratories , which has been invaluable in critical journalism .
A year before , in September 2016 , the parliament took its full support for the country &apos;s first ten @-@ anti @-@ government bill , and the parliament took his full support for the bill , by 42 of the 45 members of the 45 members of the law that later had officially issued a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the State Department of the Interior State has also sparked an example of a new anti @-@ Cuban bill .
However , it will take long time until this draft bill , the second house of parliament , decided to be passed , and decided to be passed as law .
Although rape has been diverse in recent years , the international government has been viewed as well as the international community , and the number of attacks against women and children continue to continue .
Argentina : The legalization of the WSFM Is Over the Legalizing · Global Voices

Photo shared online from the Facebook page of the National Campaign for a &quot; legal , secure and accessibility &quot; that has been widely shared online .
On June 13 , the MP &apos;s Member of Parliament announced a bill to legalize the legalization of the Argentine Congress .
Officially , the debate has already started in March - a historic milestone in the ongoing struggle for the transgender rights in Argentina .
In the past few months , both security users were both and opponents .
In the debate on the debate , the law has been screened at a few <unk> to win the votes of the votes .
For the most important changes , the opportunity for doctors to reject protected oil agencies are required to have been obligated to have been obligated to have been required to have been implemented .
Also women need the approval of her parents or their <unk> .
Meanwhile , online and offline continue to have a different debate since April , 2014 , various human rights groups and civil society groups have been campaigning for the National Campaign for a legal , secure and free abortion for their struggle for the law .
Their message reads &quot; <unk> to have a choice ; <unk> to avoid abortion ; legal abortion to avoid deaths . &quot;
At the same time , however , various religious organisations and <unk> are under the theme &quot; malnourished &quot; to save the law .
A vigil in front of the Congress was planned for June 13 , while inside the lawmakers charge in the House of Law .
Various surveys show that large parts of the population will support the law .
Even renowned journalist Eduardo Ghraieb , a vocal journalist , led to Twitter a short survey , showed it to the result :
&quot; Watch you for or legal , safe , safe and effective abortion ? &quot;
The analysis of the lawmakers &apos; analysis , however , has yet to take a sharp majority against legalizing others .
In many cases , however , however , however , however , the legislators are not able to vote either because the lawmakers don &apos;t have yet specified or because they don &apos;t have their opinion on fear or threats .
The last day of the official debate was taken by a powerful speech by the Ministry Adolfo Protection Adolfo Prudoth , who heads to the skyscrapers of lethal executed :
We have been in democracy for 35 years .
Abortion is a subject that is left among the carpet .
The evidence are clear : a candlelight leopard leads to less deaths and less abortion .
How to take action in any way .
If the proposed draft law will be implemented , he will be presenting the Senate , where there is a significant majority of the opposition .
These factors may still change , however , even depending on how the result of the debate in the House of Ideologies where the Misdemeanors Registry play a key role .
&quot; I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf that looks at the Congress &quot;
It is impossible to ignore the influence of public opinion , but also in the form of various personal stories that are widely shared online .
In one of these cases , a woman is active on the legal and economic obstacles that she had faced a medically case when she took a medically case .
She calls the doctors &apos; names not in the public , but she describes how some themselves refused to help her and how a doctor ordered money for the action :
My head and my body didn &apos;t fail to quit .
I still feel the same fear in the moment when I was treated with the help and health workers and medical practitioners that have been I needed to appreciate the leap .
When I was sleeping , I had a nightmare of Dr. N. and Dr B. I have to think , especially after I saw him in Congress .
She concludes :
I feel that I have a lot of violence in the past few days .
I have a couple of girlfriends who stood me as if I remember my hand , but I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf that ask in the Congress and ask him to vote for the decriminalization of consent .
On Twitter , users have asked themselves to comment on the bill :
The UN has termed the criminalization of abortion as an afterthought .
If the law will not be adopted , all parliamentarians who voted against this torture and sewage deaths .
They will be every single woman who have gripped the conscience .
Abortion is taking place , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just under rape for legal abortion , if not , they &apos;re <unk> that they &apos;ve done the legs , &quot; then it &apos;s not like to say , &quot; both life . &quot;
Targeted or illegal abortion , this is a question .
If the bill will be adopted , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America that the global trend will be crippled , begging or decriminalization .
The first country in the region that made this step , was Uruguay in 2012 .
As a result , the <unk> of the economy in Latin America has sunk .
Let &apos;s be the country we want .
A country without corruption , which is integrated in the world with a CA economy , social security , political dialogue , and legal abortion .

Only the death comes from the death here ; he is vague , scared neither <unk> nor <unk> or <unk> .
We entered our cell back .
After two actions we give our legs .
The other are washing the blood of the hands and feet .
They all give us a sliver of bread and provide us , and then we are going to sleep in a very deep insightful that we could be dead , even on the death of death .
This is why the next three days ; every single little update is repeated .
At the fourth day , once again a <unk> <unk> and read , it &apos;s not the name of our name .
It is harder to be in jail .
The days are hard , the nights also .
And the darkness only .
Even if you are not being tortured , for a worse is torture enough .
Have they been forgotten about us ?
Are we the rest of our life here ?
Why were we not <unk> today ?
Have they discovered the phone ?
Questions about questions that write about the head .
The day continues .
Every days - the stench of blood and <unk> , the stench of blood <unk> around you .
You give you every person to the bodies of the other inmates and the other walls .
How bad it feels like it .
The fifth day as usual , as usual .
The guards opens the door , &quot; Come off ! &quot; I leave the cell and <unk> the hands of the hands and <unk> my hands , so they can cover my head and handcuffs .
I <unk> the <unk> to a space that looks similar in my head .
&quot; On the knees , I follow the permit .
The most visual conversation will be accompanied by the <unk> of a paper on paper ; another person is now in the room . &quot; Ah , Sarmad .
You really see a good look at your age , even while you are even more than your son of a medical doctor , you can only get out of good home .
Why just just <unk> a gun with you ? &quot;
He starts with a lawsuit , in the wake of a suit , in the wake of the point that I remember in demonstrations .
I never didn &apos;t have a <unk> , I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; a <unk> of standing and I am sobbing with the bodies .
Having <unk> , perhaps a third person , sits on me and <unk> his knees directly at my shoulders .
The comuniqué continues : &quot; Listen , Sarmad , you really can tell us all in you .
We even bring you a cup of tea .
I want you to believe that you don &apos;t want a weapon with you .
But <unk> , you &apos;ll tell us that you will be joking . &quot; But I am very unpleasant , &quot; but I &apos;m still unpleasant , &quot; but I &apos;m still spending it &quot; <unk> <unk> on my backs to my feet , just after a few minutes .
&quot; In order , Sarmad , then do we hear us , &quot; he plays a video where I am seeing a demonstration in which I see a demonstration ? &quot; You can listen ?
We are treating no dignity .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Motamangeh , &quot; a thought <unk> in my head : you always say that Al Gohary &apos;s fairy tales .
Then it &apos;s also <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of the oral .
Now he starts to speak the only language that he understood , and <unk> <unk> on me , just a few little <unk> .
At the end of the blockade , I guess about an hour , I guess .
Get open I return to my cell back .
It is necessary to let me make me .
Since the first time , I feel that I feel a state of <unk> myself in his office .
With <unk> head and <unk> hands , we rushed the same way to how every morning .
The same voices of the walls .
I <unk> my breath , my breath because I don &apos;t mind because with my <unk> , &quot; If you don &apos;t stop the truck , let &apos;s stop <unk> better to breathe !
Or you want to be joking ? &quot;
I &apos;m going back and so again , as I can only feel .
I &apos;m shaking with fear or dead ?
Ah , what does this matter , or hear my teeth don &apos;t go into consideration . &quot; So good , Sarmad , why don &apos;t you care and give it a end ?
Then I can go home and release you , so you can release home .
Who still shares you ?
How did you manage to let the TV variety of TV ?
Is there anything we don &apos;t know ?
I mean , we know everything , but I would like to hear from your mouth . &quot;
No time to think , the fewer doubt you can answer , the fewer doubt .
I could have done everything and say that I did nothing .
I think they are doing this country , &quot; he says .
I &apos;m interesting ; I feel like you to see it again .
Come at me , Sarmad you are still young and left your entire future .
We can completely <unk> all doors in the nose , but we can open thousands of doors .
The decision is on you and take your look at you , you get you on Facebook or on this Yahoo language , or where you are using your videos , and tell you that they are going to go to the same thing , and tell me that we can finally go . &quot;
In such a moment , you put out every single sentence through the head that the other prisoners had told her .
The value of your life is closely with people around you .
You want to leave lists - who can &apos;t be able to be a case in danger , and who will be sacrificed if there is no other way ?
My mother often spoke from &quot; inferiority who don &apos;t even listen to his favorite enemy , &quot; one such thing <unk> I just would like , and I would like to wish it .
&quot; I use my e @-@ mail account for conversations .
As , please watch myself , I log in , &quot; After several <unk> , I &apos;m using the wrong password ( I have used a fake account ) to finally set up a fake account .
Online online , online and dozens online forums .
Nothing of it is convinced . &quot; Are you about a curious audio Linux or what ?
What don &apos;t you know what &apos; <unk> &apos; means what ?
No problem . &quot;
He took me the eye to me , acknowledging his possessions from the table and leaves the space .
Minutes from few days , without any one that is my <unk> , no prison , <unk> , <unk> me .
Then the door goes on . &quot; The voice is different .
He <unk> me in a room and starts at me .
Follow my feet after my feet .
The screams break from me .
He continues to get rid of me , my <unk> cold water <unk> .
So , for hours , I can hear so I can hear how he has a drink that he has selling medicine .
In addition to the cigarettes , it is in the room that we are in the room that we are not able to do that smoking , he expresses the <unk> on my back .
I &apos;m fed up and I &apos;ll go to me - in the compulsion that I can keep my legs on the legs .
After several of the cases , I will have to do and I am back to my cell .
I immediately went into the powerlessness .
This is just a <unk> of a <unk> system where the way the way is made for crimes and the symbolism of the criminals who are present in jail .
It is a system that wants to create the illusion of freedom - one of the dictatorship <unk> freedom , because they escalated the truth quickly .
Sarmad you cannot sleep all day , you have to stand up and wash you , &quot; The voice belongs to Abdel Rahman .
In fact , I have been given to the brief moment of how to be found on the eve of the next day , when usual , &quot; quiet , &quot; they are very quiet , and they &apos;ll give you out elsewhere .
Just like everyone else , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smiles never leaves his face when he is talking .
Earlier , he worked on the interrogation floor in Maputo and the occasion he received many books .
At a police attack , several banned books were discovered in him - and a few pictures he was seen as demonstrator .
The occasion is enough to catch him .
There are some new prisoners on the day .
All people talk from a few <unk> who was locked up in the leg , &quot; she had to pick him to the leg .
And then he &apos;s wearing <unk> with a knife and <unk> her life so much , &quot; one of the <unk> , contrary to the <unk> , completely impressed by <unk> force .
He continues : &quot; He is big and strong , he was grown . &quot;
Another number of hours to file the name .
We all let us go to all the <unk> hole in the door to catch a glimpse of him , a Nepalese , young young man , and his legs <unk> his legs to see the wounds of bones surrounded by the bullet &apos;s bone , and in his neck .
Those guards are afraid of him !
She steps at the first .
We &apos;re sitting in deep silence , hoping to hear everything there was just true .
Nothing !
It <unk> us from our routine , <unk> fate .
Figuring out when they brought him into the room .
The time passes without someone there is a word from there .
It &apos;s all about his previous experience , so they don &apos;t know , so they don &apos;t have any choice if there is no choice to go out there or then ?
The door on the floor will be <unk> .
The steps of the tribunal come closer .
Our cell will open and get away .
Then the door concludes .
We wait until the guards continued and washing friendly wounds , from head to head .
If we dogs come somewhere somewhere in these distant countries , we are now getting around 5,500 and entertained , even locally .
But here as a human being <unk> you are in the series ; either <unk> you about her wounds or her to your own .
It &apos;s an hour , since it has been <unk> again , and more than minutes , he creates a few minutes .
Then he keeps his hand on the <unk> !
This is more than a window to a grave ; only guards and guards use him .
None of us had so close to <unk> .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a relatively smart young man , and I have a lot of women in the nose .
Maybe it is your sister under them ?
Do you see so evil at me ?
Or I ask you about the ass and you &apos;ve got to be out of my blood ?
Even if you say , we would have to be able to find this real place .
Don &apos;t reason you all of these anger . &quot;
Laughing , and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of others , let me know , and I was almost sure I was almost sure . &quot; We only live , and we just have a God .
We knew that we could die .
Then we scare them at least a box .
Or do you think that these killers around us are just killing other people because we are afraid of them ?
<unk> - They have much more afraid of us than we were . &quot;
He argued intentionally , so that we can hear .
Three of them <unk> the door and consult open in the cell .
They beat up <unk> on <unk> and decided to go outside .
It should be the last time I see <unk> military rationing in Deir Tokyu &apos;s square .
In the drawing , Filipino students are making attention to injustice and human rights abuses in their country on the drawing , the shooting of a unarmed youth by a unarmed young people .

The patrols that was passed in January earlier this year will be allowed to regulate commercial activities , including the sale of books in the cultural sector .
The controversial regulations provide rules within the cultural sector and demand how those who provide artistic services to provide links to the official institutions .
In addition , penalties will be defined by the demands of the requirements , despite the authorities the authorities have the right to do .
Other measures can also be carried out with the decree &apos;s use of fines and search practices , equipment and other ways to use the activity of the activity .
The evolution of the evolution will be ended with immediate effect .
The controversial nature of the norm also reflects the norm in one of the articles that &quot; the dignity of the people &quot; were injured .
This will face discrimination due to discrimination or sexual orientation , as violent as violent images of crimes that would be a complete exception in the cultural region .
A lot of opponents of the decree will take advantage of the promise of the decree in the same manner , and that it will prevent the reach of the artistic news .
One of the most persistent arguments is that these acts of blocking of independent artists <unk> and the door would open the door for strict policy policies and censorship .
The campaign for the decree completed the decree &apos;s charge with discussions about a new constitution in the Republic of Cuba .
Many believe that this discourse have been carried out by the protests against the decree .
In the midst of the discussion , a group of intellectuals , artists and activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s Sunflower Fund en meters ( IUFRO ) , among the members of the group &apos;s members of the group Luis Manuel Zapatero &apos;s poets , the Yemeni poet writer Manuel Manuel Onetti , and the rapper of David David , who supports the initiative .
Science and David are also involved in the project &apos;s project .
The campaign is trying to collect 10,000 signatures ; this is the number of a legal norm in the Cuban constitution to reach a <unk> norm .
Meanwhile , a petition and open letter to Avaaz has been shared on the discussions to bring the norm of norm .
In the text , the <unk> <unk> expresses their concern for the art and culture in Cuba over the coming years that state authorities will decide to exercise who will be used to work , and who is allowed to exercise them :
Today , the crowd provides a crowd to support new sources of support for artistic projects .
The fact that a Cuban artist is being able to fund its own resources through their own resources , and it does not use new technologies to spread their work on the brink of the established community .
It will also be the risks raised in question with the murky legal criteria in the decree , such as the punishment of &quot; <unk> content against ethical and cultural values . &quot;
The open letter is based on president of Cuba , Miguel Díaz , and at the new culture culture , murdered Alonso , and has been signed by artists and academics such as catcalls and academics by artists and academics .
The elders of the signatories of the letter will be shared by the organization &apos;s organization :
The independent artist or those who have no connection with state institutions or groups of civil society are doubly beatings , because of which the nature and means of expression is perceived to be seen as a protest as a protest , and expressed political opinion .
Furthermore , questions were related to the influence of the religious spheres in religious spheres .
This is also known as a <unk> ( known as a <unk> ) in Cuba , a far @-@ known religion in Cuba where both dance and music are part of rituals .
At the same time , a hip @-@ hop song carrying the various protests that David D &apos; <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and the title of the band &quot; para para Ricardo &quot; :
Your censorship shows in the closing of concerts that you inherit .
They &apos;ve always been able to go to them .
You give us to join the art , tell us
What did you get involved in the constitution against artists ?
Enough with the growing oppression .
Ryskulova has published Jorge Angel Hernández at a Creative Commons magazine called &quot; La petite , &quot; in the Yahoo magazine La Reservation , which publishes the article &quot; Del Ludovica , &quot; :
The most violent reactions to the decree of a future chaos with the representation of a future chaos by censorship and repression ; they claim to protect the barriers and protect their financial sources , which allow them to share a role in various levels of international audience .

Although the government has tried to reduce the poverty of women with political measures , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence from the government &apos;s independence are not particularly targeted by the government &apos;s government .
programs for <unk> of income of income , including 2006 , and three months since 2011 , have been established by the City of the slum , since 2006 , and three years have been established in extreme poverty since 2011 .
Together both programs between 150 and 350 dollars of the children are dependent on the number of children .
On the other hand , abortion has been illegal in Venezuela as illegal as illegal ; a legacy of previous political policy in the country that the country &apos;s <unk> has been radical .
Neither Chávez still took power to the past 20 years in the 20 years .
Abortion is only allowed when the mother &apos;s life is in danger .
Aglaia Berlutti , well @-@ known feminist voice in the internet and points out the misgivings of the <unk> rhetoric in terms of gender equality :
... in Venezuela has consumed &apos; feminism &apos; from power , <unk> , and especially <unk> .
While you spoke from the policy of politics , President Nicolás Maduro has been modified to protect minority minorities , while the number of coordination in the Legislative Yuan is the <unk> of all others in the continent , where their identity continues to be <unk> because of a historic interpretation of the country , which is continuing to be <unk> .
Not only did not solve existing problems : the acute economic crisis is also dangerous .
According to three local organizations , the rate of interest in Venezuela is one of the most femicides in Venezuela .
There were various cases of sexual abuse against women &apos;s case of violence during the protests during the protests .

Iranian crime and violence has increased in recent years , and many women have to complain about the death of their children .
In La Imran de <unk> ( The lives of us ) , a project from media sharing the personal information of the crisis , recalls <unk> <unk> about the murder of their two children :
After roughly half a hours , she called me to say that I should arrest my children .
My heart came out of the chest when I saw her .
Our <unk> were so unbelievable .
They were like this kind of kind !
They didn &apos;t have a shirt and shoes they gave me the <unk> message of my life .
The story has repeated repeated : They have taken a child again .
The also reflects the permanent absence of sexual education in school , along with lack of access to investors due to the shortage of medicine in the country due to a shortage of medicines in the country .
Gheorghe Harneis , researcher at the Centre of the Central Asia Institute of Venezuela , explains :
... there is a secret , small but important , mothers of mothers in their sexual <unk> .
Many of the young <unk> are not being carried out .
After eight months , they die in the hospital with a infection and the base that survive , come back to the neighborhood to get a child without the support of parents .
Ultimately , the women who leave the country are confronted with difficulties .
The number of people displaced by human trafficking in Latin America and in 2018 have quadruple by 2014 and 2018 .
In neighbouring Colombia , there are more than a million Venezuelans in the past year , making women prejudice and abuse .
Many are criticizing the Venezuelan migrant to &quot; steal &quot; and be involved in &quot; stealing crime &quot; and the women are usually regarded as a prostitute .
To raise awareness of these false ideas , the feminist channel Las Marley ( the <unk> ) in the Colombian city of Colombia has seen a drone official in the Colombian state sector .

It is also believed that the insurgents are believed to have been displaced by insurgents , in southern province of otaku Delgado in southern areas , where they have been illegal illegally , before they have been authorized to compete with the <unk> of weapons broadcasting , 2012 .

OTV is a young activist and Computer @-@ engineer engineer who founded on Facebook with &quot; insulting a Agenda for Sexual Diversity in Cuba &quot; ( <unk> for agenda for Strategic Habits ) in Cuba , which has recently created a place for conversations and discussions .
Recently , his work began as activist after his experience as a migrant rights for the National Centre for Conservation of Development ( Mwatana ) .
For two years , he is working on the University of computer Science in downtown Italy and Save the name of sexual health and rights , &quot; Love at a Second <unk> &quot; ( love for the second glance ) .
In 2014 , he was doing best for Latin America and the Caribbean International Conference of the International Daily International Conference of the International Lesbian Conference ( WSFM , World Wide Programme , World Health Committee , World Health Organisation ) .
Currently , he &apos;s a member of the Oscar Valley in Oscar Valley , where he works with initiatives of young people working with grassroots equality .
The interviews of interviews is the current debate in Cuba for all which is not recognized by the country &apos;s constitution .
In our conversations , many interesting aspects of the debate has been cited by the level that the people of marriage are looking for the different lesbian community , gay @-@ sex transgender , transgender , bisexual , bisexual and intersex ( <unk> ) communities to regulate the lives of the citizens &quot; lives .
Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should people think that people should have the opportunity to legalize their relationship ?
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think that it should be a legal thing for a legal interpretation .
Especially because many of the legal law , including those who believe in inter @-@ intellectual property , are also recognized by the law and recognized the law .
Like this kind of fairness , it may be marriage for all , intersex <unk> or something else will depend on what our revolutionists turn and advise us from our ability to overcome us .
At the international level , there are several countries where such mechanisms is part of their justice .
In Cuba , we have not done the first step .
I personally don &apos;t think that a legally effective contract would guarantee a emotional stability that can be guaranteed , but can help protect legacy , <unk> and avoid injustice .
The emergence of the legal system , which is the right of same @-@ sex couples to adoption .
It &apos;s a matter that only a few people speak in Cuba .
It is complicated and not to be ethical .
GV : Do you think you will be a national referendum to determine whether to determine whether to be younger partnerships between people of the same gender / <unk> in Cuba ?
Setya : I personally believe that the right to people don &apos;t be exposed to <unk> reformist statements , not even the majority .
However , there are some legal procedures that cannot be left out of eight .
For example , marriage is defined in the Cuban Constitution ( Article 36 ) as &quot; Liter of Light tower , among a man and a woman who hasn &apos;t seen legally . &quot;
The most vulnerable communities in the world .
Some of the points could be introduced here for recognition for recognition of a formal marriage , not a national vote , without a national choice .
This second option seems to be the <unk> , but it seems to have limited reach .
If they are supposed to determine , marriage would still be a proper right / privilege for child @-@ sex couples while same @-@ sex couples would be satisfied with a high @-@ extra community or <unk> community .
But I should note that there is a lot of violence between people of the same gender in the same gender .
That is why I think the point of every legal initiative will be discussed , and the agenda is considered to consider the agenda of the activists and organizations .
In terms of Marriage , <unk> said :
I think I am impressed with the cold .
With the beginning of the story , marriage is a tool to clarify the creation of peace , displacement and Jewish @-@ Christian <unk> .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give her a chance , but I think the debate has not reached the <unk> that they should have .
So I would like to throw questions about the future questions for future debates :
Why is the right to marriage in such a situation ?
What is the place of the sexual diversity ?
Does it make sense to fight marriage equality only because they have the right ?
What is the real <unk> of this legal atrocity ?
So if we talk about recognition of same @-@ sex couples , this is only the relationship between two people ?
What happens to the <unk> relationship ?
Should you be left outside ?
What will sex marriage change for trans access to medicines and <unk> ?
Will marriage bring change for a lesbian woman who wants to get care of their athletes in Cuba ?
Because the <unk> of the Ministry for public health is due to <unk> @-@ sex couples , it would not be a requirement that a couple of the couple must be <unk> .
GV : Is you a case or an immigrant science in Cuba who learned people who have no developed partnership ?
Setya : I have many cases known .
One friend , which has been a friend after the death of his partner partner , has been working together with the death of its partner .
It &apos;s a beautiful story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased had taken him from the house .
After his death , this father was almost all hers .
Since the community was not recognized , there was no legal situation .
In addition , there are many in many areas ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) and <unk> for couples who remain failed for couples @-@ sex couples .
GV : Four years ago , a commentator named Jassim Martínez Hernández named Hernández Martínez Hernández ( Secretary of Chinese Communist Party ) made the following comment : &quot; Marriage for all , is worrying to the society , and it would be the same way of responsibility for justice between people and animals .
It shouldn &apos;t be legal because it is not normal .
There are couples who spend their entire life without marrying marriage , for others not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer such a way ?
Note : At all , I would like to highlight that the comment you see , was motivated by an article which was published on May 6 , 2014 .
In an article published by the journalist , journalist SamSays , a journalist and the current journalist of the International Lesbian Secretary of International Lesbian ( TTENT ) , has taken pictures of the International Lesbian Association ( KICS ) , a blog hosted by the International Orchestra .
Femen &apos;s comment reflects the personal opinion of someone who make themselves open to all .
It is his opinion , and I respect them but I respect her high ignorance .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is so relative that the octopus itself is .
What is a normal and of course , it is for the others to be not and other .
This is how it has been about the course of the story .
During the time of slavery , it &apos;s a matter of people as &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; normal , &quot; something what is going to be a punishable up today .
If there is a fact that I am completely convinced that the love we are doing same @-@ sex people , such as the love we explain each other as the love that explain to each other .
Guatemala &apos;s Foreign Court agrees for a United Nations High Council · Global Voices
The Constitutional Court in Guatemala .

The next 48 hours are crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court asked the government in a secret sentence of Pakistan &apos;s lawyers , who will allow the return to the country and leave his work as director of the United Nations supported the International Commission of Guatemala ( Alisher <unk> ) la <unk> en Guatemala , short <unk> en Guatemala .
Last month , Guatemala &apos;s president Jimmy Morales did not approve Guatemala &apos;s mandate last month , which is currently in the United States , which is currently in the United States that return to Guatemala .
The decision has sparked both national and international outrage and resulted in protests and protests .
Earlier the trial , the commission and members of his family had been accused of corruption and members of his family corruption in the room , therefore Morales , and its intellectual accounts is now related to the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not just a test for democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors that have done in the past .
According to an official state official , Morales could propose to prove that legal action will lead to the President &apos;s ouster .
Journalists like Nina creativo and other commenters on social media are witnessing the current situation and the different scenarios , especially when Morales should refuse to ask the army &apos;s decision and support the army :
Guatemala : The Court of Constitutional Court is final .
The system of the constitution is not possible to ignore the ruling , which the ruling is not possible to ignore by President @ <unk> .
What will he do and his network of the elites do ?
To be able to afford or <unk> with a coup ?
Human rights activists , including the most prominent human rights activists , responded with relief and establishments , but also with concern the government &apos;s next steps :
Lots of citizens of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s continue against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It was forced to come .
The honorable Constitutional Court has <unk> the public order .
What could happen next 48 hours to Guatemala if <unk> <unk> to Guatemala ?
A political deja vu ? ?
Given the long and tough fight against corruption and political turmoil in recent months in Guatemala , these events have a very special meaning .
This is how the political process of Morales started against corruption against corruption and impunity that have been deployed to large swathes of political class and the former President Otto Pérez Molina .
In the political crisis of 2015 , the commission &apos;s presence and investigation has been an important role in which government officials would stand under a halt .
Now , where Morales itself is in the center of political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment when Guatemala could seem either a major step in Guatemala or a lack of <unk> .
Salvadoran journalist Héctor Silva revealed links to the norms between Morales &apos; health system and Morales &apos; of the President :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala with support to support groups , including some with links to military service .
When he took place , he said he was not a thief or a thief .
Today , he is a president who <unk> from <unk> power to prevent corruption against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # <unk> ( &quot; resignation now ) , which was used during the protests of 2015 , has new followers and protests on the street .
At the same time , international media outlets have also highlighted the importance of the crisis in Guatemala as the Colombian daily newspaper El País also called for the international community to track more developments in the country :
No matter the current situation shows the tension surrounding the situation in this country and that a sore point has hit a sore point , no doubt that the issue will be resolved without modern investigations .
That &apos;s why the international community has to protect the people of Guatemala at the protection of its institutions and search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be endangered by Guatemala during this <unk> , and the exit could have a huge impact on the story of one of the Mahmood &apos;s owners that have a similar stance on the story .
Are this the last recent <unk> period in <unk> ?
Mass violence in Tibet .

In the hills of northern Sikkim in the hills of northern India , the community is a peaceful coexistence and hard life .
From the hills resounds the songs the songs that have <unk> for each other .
They are not an average @-@ average villagers who live decades in the same place , and an ranking revenue .
The cave dwellers are also nomadic , like their name suggests - &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> and can roughly be translated down with &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of <unk> . &quot;
But during the past generations , however , the line of money that could be lost in <unk> will be lost in <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk> saw many challenges , such as climate change , lack of infrastructure , economic insecurity and <unk> of a minor and health crisis in a city .
These challenges have been closed as a red borders since the 1960s .
Being a more comprehensive struggle to lead the lives of a gender race , with the result that the number of people who are willing to take advantage of traditional lives .
Before 1962 , the holiday climbed every year of Tibet , where she was originally settled in the northern areas of <unk> to allow their homes .
During the opening time , she temporarily went near <unk> <unk> in Tibet , where the grass was more likely to get more and <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> .
She moved south in the northern region of the northern hot region , and remained some time in areas such as olive groves , <unk> , <unk> and smiles .
There were also a compilation of the confusion from the laughter of the laughter of the laughter , which is not only economic and culturally for both sides .
The trade was used to cultural exchange and collaborations to the peaceful building of the two communities .
In exchange , the <unk> <unk> around the cattle of cattle and sold the <unk> , after she left their own , <unk> @-@ <unk> community with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from livestock .
This exchange was <unk> through the agreement between Tibet and India , as well as through the open borders that allow it to be free .
After the occupation of China &apos;s occupation , the border was closed , and the <unk> were forced to settle in 1962 .
Since then , it has been limited to a region , both in winter and in the summer .
Dr. Anna Silcock Tithi , the director of the Central Institute for Institute in Sikkim , says that the company &apos;s claim is that the company &apos;s claim that there was about 1000 <unk> in front of a 1000 <unk> that has collected the annual <unk> of <unk> of <unk> .

Outside of adversity
The traditional way of life of the economy is not easy .
Due to the restriction of her passion on <unk> <unk> , they are faced in winter weather conditions , since it is in the northern parts of Japan &apos;s northern laboratories that include more severe properties of the green <unk> .
&quot; If there &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s very difficult to get both the animals like us , &quot; says Mejia <unk> in a movie of the Argentinian Institute for Monitoring Film titled &quot; Santandano <unk> at the border - the <unk> of North @-@ <unk> . &quot;
The number of oil companies are dependent on <unk> , but also heat is increasingly becoming a problem .
According to research sources , the average temperature <unk> in <unk> is around 2.5 degrees .
This has led to a lack of violence and the heat is preparing the heat to be raised on the relevant complaints .
The animals are being used to a exposure and the <unk> are forced to sell they either sell or sell them , as the grass in winter is covered with snow .
This means a additional edition to buy the <unk> .
So far , the traditional community is based on the traditional community , which is based on their daily demand and <unk> of goods .
Since the start of the <unk> , the community has to leave the army when they need to leave medical care , even if the army can &apos;t afford to afford medical treatment .
In such cases , the simple survival is very sensitive .
To understand the <unk> , you have to understand that the university plays a central role in the heart of the community of life , and they find milk and milk , adding to different products , just like <unk> , <unk> .
From bitterly , things like <unk> , clothing and <unk> are made .
In recent times , too , expensive <unk> , <unk> and comforting <unk> , made out of the overcrowded marble village who were trapped in Tibet and served as a sewing .
Due to the economy , one of the trade has been suspended .
The milk fare is mainly in winter , especially for tea - in this neighborhood of Chai - and in the summer , Chai &apos;s <unk> and other races .
None of the main tribes were currently sold in places where he is married to live in the places , where a businessman has become a rare study .
Even after all these years , the conservationists are still less than guests and not as residents of the area .
Nor have to be caught and had to be careful , not only because their herds will go together , but also because they have to toe the rules and regulations of the Tibetan communities .
A uncertain future for the profession in the country &apos;s career
Yet , despite all this backdrop , there are some <unk> to a living .
They <unk> the gaps in the <unk> of <unk> villagers in the face of <unk> fish and <unk> for the army .
In addition to the herds , clothes , food and other <unk> , many have to carry out the cost of their children at the risk of their children , when they decided to send their children to schools in cities .
After their training and urban life , the children are often going to return to the <unk> @-@ subsidized medical clinic , and &quot; If everything else is different , life is the life of the last few , &quot; says Dr. Anna Jaoude .
Young men also <unk> in front of the age as a child , because they would not find any bride .
Those who hold the profession from inside the country is mostly shot from the army , government or other urban jobs .
With the recent increase in tourism in <unk> in <unk> , work in the sector also asked .
Those who don &apos;t have money , let alone the Tibetan Twittersphere in the Tibetan Twittersphere .
Neither the government &apos;s decision provided by the government is still a couple of less non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ profit organizations to continue the traditional way of life .
Despite all this , there are those who carry together their traditional counterparts and lives in the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
But they themselves are aware that their children will choose to sell their livestock to sell livestock themselves in cities , and other jobs .
This a generation could easily write the last chapter in the history of Yaounde as a <unk> in <unk> .

He spoke about his life after his arrest , his experience in the refugee camp , and gave advice for other artists .
Ali says that despite his new life in Norway , he is very difficult to adapt with his new life in Norway .
After two weeks I fell into a deep depression that took place in exhaustion , and it took four to five months until I took care of the help of a psychologists , and some friends , and I was planning to build a new life and build a new life .
He remembered his decision to persuade cartoons after he suggested a medical employee that he had to carry out a activity to carry out a activity , but it wasn &apos;t just true - the detainees had no access to paper and pens .

And that was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The art doesn &apos;t help me to be better , but it has helped me to help my voice in the world outside the world .
It was the art that saved me , it was the art that saved my life .
His drawings of medical guards went on to the attention of medical expenses , first at the first time on the ground , then on Manus .
Then , Australian media have been focusing on his art on his artwork on Manus Square :

Stop not on , stop what you do .
Long continue , attract cartoons , send your voice in the world .
It takes his time , it &apos;s difficult but it will work , it &apos;s working with me .
Don &apos;t stop .
For five years , I asked for help and get it .
I got my freedom when I asked for a few years to ask for help .
To ask help , not embarrassing .

The truth has helped me .
The truth has helped me to get my freedom back .
It took long , but it works
