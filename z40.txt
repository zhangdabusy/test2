In different places , particularly in West Africa has called migration as &quot; <unk> &quot; as <unk> .
Many are considered to find the migration as a normal strategy , but it doesn &apos;t matter , &quot; whether it has been migration in neighboring countries or migration in neighboring countries - the number of migration , especially in West Africa - or if you travel to greater distance , &quot; she writes .
The goal of the migration is not always the target of migration .
Tinystar323 writes :
These travels often do not have a certain place .
You can stay in half distance to work for a place to work and money .
And then , it remains to be a more place for some time .
Or you will be deported from the country .
The whole thing is more nuanced and more than the way to Europe as he is so often represented .
Without work and opportunities in their <unk> , it will be the easiest decision to leave home and select a better future .
Just as a young person is the decision to go , it &apos;s a decision of dignity , &quot; you hope to do what a <unk> , responsible person , and for their family .

The judge agrees : &quot; It &apos;s about to improve the situation .
Among the youth in Mali , the narrative is to do something to do something for his country .
There is a basic sense that the political system will help the youth . &quot;
For those young people who are expected to be expected , they can be able to take their visa as adults , search for hope outside their country .
As long as they do not change in their own country , young people will make their way to other places .
&quot; It &apos;s OK &quot; who is ok ?
In the same words , &quot; It &apos;s OK &quot; to stay in their country .
But who can guarantee the situation , guarantee guarantee that the current situation will be okay ?
Like many other campaigns of the EU , the video is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and mentioned the possibility that the young people in their country are not acceptable .
The idea is : &quot; If they want to keep the message at home , they would have some of the possibilities they have to show it . &quot;

With the FSB &quot; containing laptops <unk> &quot; the girls show how much they hate them hate .
It should be allowed to understand that they should be able to understand that they must stop sexual harassment and attacks .
Women who drive with the train is often often populated by the train .
According to the Japan Times :
The figures of the survey show that there were documented cases of torture or harassment in 2017 , which reached 30 percent between 7 and 9 a.m .
More than 50 percent of the cases have appeared on trains , according to the report , and another 20 % on Delhi .
At the same time , there were reports that nearly 30 percent of the victims are killed .
Non @-@ incidents cases are being treated by police under the Criminal Code of Criminal Code under the Criminal Code of Criminal Code .
It is also hard reports that it is difficult to track such cases .
Although the police and the staff are regularly looking on , these messages are usually starting to stop the women in the trains so they can help themselves or try to prevent the process of men , not trying to change the behaviour of men .
The comments are often trying to assess what such behavior and media is focusing on how men can be focusing on <unk> against false accusations of <unk> .

&quot; The perpetrators didn &apos;t recognize a sign of <unk> , &quot; says I never don &apos;t want to experience the girl .
And so they created a map , which reads :
&quot; I don &apos;t stop this !

Then the girl set up this map of their community and took into school .
She never was <unk> again .
Iranglobal reports that the campaign was a number of success in social media in social media , and it was about the idea of the idea .

To make sure that the young women would get the design , they collected design ideas of <unk> people who took over five .
In addition to the issue in January , the Paraguayan Main Center for Women &apos;s Center ( Order to Prevent sexual harassment ) was set to raise awareness about the issue .
The idea for this horrendous campaign is that the girls can do with harassment , and that the society show that <unk> is not essential :
The concept of these <unk> :
:
- No one of <unk> <unk>
- No one is a <unk>
- No one <unk> as a <unk>
In 2015 , the <unk> was created for sale on the Internet for sale on the Internet .
However , they are still available , but with increasing understanding of the campaign , this campaign will now be discussed , and in the stores that are popular among the students .

Without Paper , Electricity and News : Censorship in Venezuela · Global Voices
A representation of the forum Eduardo Viajar is a representation of the media &apos;s censorship platform in Venezuela .
Used with permission .
In the midst of protests against social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , state control control over the coverage of the country &apos;s social and economic crisis .
In June 2018 , Venezuelans have been blocked with <unk> , pornographic websites and the Tor Tor Tor .
The path was long and <unk> .
As the government &apos;s government of the late president Hugo Chávez has started to access radio and television , many media outlets who have been charged with President Nicolás Maduro , who had been doused with a business business in which the state has been acting and a routine influence on their biases and commercial activity .
Additionally , the National Assembly adopted the National Assembly ( ANC ) , which has been carried out by the Migration Committee of the National Constituent Assembly - a controversial law that promotes social media and other media outlets .
If you have pointed out that people have been arrested due to tweets , it seems that it has been active since it has been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis is causing a shortage of goods and basic services , such as paper , electricity , and <unk> .
The shortage in connection with political reasoning and news has implemented public access to information and news , has a common and heavily controlled situation for communication and spreading information .
Newspapers go online ... and then blocked
With the rapid rise in the process of <unk> and very hard @-@ intensive paper , local newspapers ( especially the Russian newspapers ) were forced to stop their expenses or <unk> them online , without guarantee their audiences .
In the beginning of 2018 , a journalist tweeted :
The report is reported that the public domain of El Alto is blocked in the country .
Today , I observed that my computer access to El Maps , La Propaladora and other Venezuelan websites that have been blocked for the dictatorship .
Do others have the problem ?
In order to report a report .
Months later , journalists reported on Twitter and other media outlets that El National Day was blocked in the country :
This is how El Maps is on the server &apos;s servers :
&quot; Not to consolidate , it &apos;s about banning &quot;
Once Público , an organization that defend free expression and access to information , condemned on her Twitter page that looters , social content , social content , use sexual content as <unk> and <unk> .
The measure has attracted the attention of the public and the media inside and abroad .
Sylvain reuniting , who shared the authoritarian views on morality and public views :
The question that needs to be caught here is how it could come .
Everyone would say that Chavism is a regime that has been a regime , but in all sectors of society .
Those who try to carry out him in their way , will have a full rule on the society .
Other users started quick to analyze the real reach of the measure and their close connection with Internet censorship - not only in Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main ban isn &apos;t just the ban on pornographic sites , which is so far that the ban is also underway , but that the ban is also underway .
What do they prevent banning porn sites ?
They do the blocking of other sites that will be going to YouTube .
Yet other users , however , suggest that it does not matter or maintain censorship .
They continue broadband Internet and the control of the actual problem :
Early the ban by Porn sites or <unk> , it has been set up because the government wants to protect children .
The real reason is that Venezuela has not had money to pay the bandwidth to those who are provided with Internet access to Internet access .
What alternatives are there ?
Perhaps Tor can help Tor
Tor is an free software used to browse the web , and it allows many internet users to use the internet .
The ban on various social network sites seem to seem to be completely effective and therefore is not entirely effective .
However , organizations like Acceso Libre or Conspiracy Sin notices that Tor was blocked .
They urge solutions to end these restrictions :
We can confirm that Tor is blocked ( in direct combination ) , we can use it on <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
It &apos;s been reported on Twitter by @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To circumvent censorship , we can use bridges and Tor :
However , if you look at context and history , the projection of freedom of expression and information is black .
Many Venezuelans are asking what media or content are next to be censored and what can be done to have the government &apos;s actions .

Since there are several land and university professors , fear that the <unk> - more than 12 metres in depth - the habitat of fish change or destroy the existence of the local fishermen .

There are regulations to control the power system .
The National Environment Association for Migration ( National Environment ) , however , has only managed a low level budget to rise by officials .
The chairman of the parliamentary committee of the parliamentary committee for natural resources , Alex Problem , says that their task is not allowed to protect the environment and destroy companies to destroy the habitat of the land and infrastructures :
It &apos;s dedicated to regulate activities in conservation sector , but by their misgivings is beginning to regulate the scale of environmental degradation in the areas where the screening of the flow of environmental degradation in the area where the shores of the tiger spill and in <unk> <unk> .
To end the damage to the halt , it will be a &quot; job of job &quot; hard to say , at least , at least the clarification .
The struggle for water and environmental and environment believes that the sand might not be stopped , but there is consensus that all companies should do this in the real way of doing this in the right way .

TO FORGET .
I am a staunch supporter of the city of Ministers ; to get to learning and collect new experiences .
This belief is both for the <unk> and intellectual .
So , as a occasion for a temporary organization , an international international non @-@ profit organization , I packed my suitcase and made me on the way to Europe .
I didn &apos;t care about the big money that we were always said there would be us even though the salary was .
The idea that no one is prepared to be prepared , and with rare reporting , what it is meant to be in a institution that is a white majority .
Shot in Uganda and mainly in the African region of the Great lakes , I had no real idea what it would mean .
Even though I was familiar with the <unk> in Africa , it was also clear how there was WMD in the Democratic Republic of Congo in his film &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in his film &quot; <unk> <unk> on &quot; <unk> , I had not made the experience , a minority .
Since the arrival of Oxfam in Haiti , the international NGO dedicated to sex teachers in the country , according to the international NGO &apos;s revelations , has been a number of international opposition officials in the past few months .
Following the related events and some other <unk> projects in the international media environment , Angela Bruce testing announced that the recent <unk> of the recent <unk> of humanitarian aid in Haiti has been one of the highest and <unk> responses to the world &apos;s humanitarian aid .
Her article , &quot; however , they &apos;re <unk> your <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; But you &apos;ll see your <unk> face until they see your black face &quot; ) where she moved to inclusion and racism in <unk> , leaving a deep impression of how long .
On the other hand , the comments of other black women and social confrontations that have had to be afraid to survive .
I had a lot to experience international organizations and knew the need of the local population to be represented in these organizations .
I &apos;ve already felt very excited about the media &apos;s cartoons , as they look at the media , as well .
The new occasion also offered me to <unk> me in one of the world &apos;s biggest challenges - <unk> migration , migration migration .
But neither my education in gender questions and <unk> even my experience during short @-@ year @-@ old and <unk> had to prepare me to this scenario .
Later , I learned that I went to a time in the diversity ( rather than inclusion ) .
My <unk> sat at the management with me and sought recognition for a welcome African woman in the team .
A few months later , two magnificent workers from Kenya and South Sudan were held in the press service until there was only a White Helmets .
One day , our <unk> gave the only African <unk> in the classroom , and called us three to call us three African staff staff .
Perhaps the normal nature of the public has managed to collect points in this organization , but it was also the first sign that things would go smoothly .
We exchanged a brave smile with the managers and our work .
That was the first time I was at a home mine alone because of my skin skin .
Until that day , no one did not have any harassment of the superiors .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> took me to my door , crying .
I cried because these African women escape the war and take their mental health and clear strength , she had come to pass with a Masters and all that she had come to meet .
I cried because I was not talking about my fellow friends , my African expats , and I was convinced it was my duty to protect them from one of these <unk> .
The head of the group was a white Europeans who had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was called &quot; very intelligent &quot; to cover the experiences of migrants - and you know what a large number of migrants refer to : &quot; poor Africans , &quot; as I heard on different occasions .
For this man , we were fascinated by African <unk> , no people with skills that deserve their jobs .
To take part in the whole world , the situation has been the most beautiful in the team .
For everything , because they were doing this woman at meetings , seriously .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should participate in a particular meeting that I realized that it was a lot of work on my desk .
Within the next 30 minutes , the band Véderő stood in my door and demanded that I go to the meeting and made clear that I did not want to conform to this woman .
I was surrounded by the officer &apos;s priorities .
The role that this white woman was in the racist and bitter environment was just clear .
She was the one who decided to get a contract like my colleague from Kenya to get the hard tour .
I can &apos;t be seen as much as I got looking at <unk> and a sincere sense of abuse on me , because the same cause was not brought to the end of the day .
And <unk> , if someone from another branch of mine <unk> my efforts .
They were complacent .
The supervisor expressed his hostility to mourn female genital mutilation - all who knows - and also <unk> comments about these women .
Although most of the middle @-@ middle members of the USSR knew the officer &apos;s fortunes , the man had never had a chance to address the issue .
While the work itself was interesting , and I had a lot of thought , I had to pay for a cost , with ignorance , sexism , and racism .
After six months , I received a contract at another branch , but my <unk> wanted me to end him .
The fact that I had a contract without his pen , pushed him into his worst behaviour .
I shared a office with another white person who calls all his calls at the Ye loudspeakers , the reporter who started calling on me to express myself and call myself with all of them .
I told others that the plan was to resign to resignation , which I had even remember this .
But I had a digital system from the lack of food .
I had managed to build employees in <unk> relationships , even though it was usually a mention of the <unk> of <unk> .
But all this was not , as long as I showed the superiors to not be thankful and turns out .
The obvious censorship and <unk> have led two colleagues to leave their job ; one of the other family members ; one of the others were denied because of the white branch of the branch .
We tried to defend these racism and sexism .
Last year , high high high high @-@ ranking colleagues said it would be impossible to do something because &quot; he &apos;s good connections with the Big mafia . &quot;
It was also pointless to consult the debate .
Even a recent Liberian colleague who assured me that it would be as an liberal pointless to report the events because I would risk a poor assessment .
Given all of these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave the organization because of a year that allows the organization to make adequate conclusions and justice .
But wait , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 percent of all labor workers in an sector where women are the ones who are affected by the people , and I hope that the discussions of racism and abuse are to show the scale of racism and abuse in foreign development projects .
The responsible need to find solutions for inclusion - not only in the way of raising more families of minorities and women in <unk> , but ensure that there are real rules , <unk> practices and opportunities to prevent such abuses .

Rape Rape Toll in Camp · Global Voices
More than two decades of civil war and famine forced many people to leave their home and live in refugee camps .
Women and girls living in camps outside of big cities are the most frequently affected by sexual abuse .
They are vulnerable , and most rape are all in the middle of the night or when they collect funds from remote locations .
In the same time , victims often have not been a way to give a legal counsel , but it would be necessary to gain justice .
Goyo , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old child @-@ year @-@ old girl , resident , resident , was raped by the eyes of her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , she described the attack as saying :
It was midnight when a armed man sat in a <unk> room in my uniform <unk> me after <unk> and raped .
He didn &apos;t even raped me , but also <unk> me with a severe wound on my body , which is still a lot of pain .
At the night of the Equinox , men of police officers arrived at the dilapidated dilapidated camps in the central city of Maracay .
The men <unk> in tents and rapidly <unk> and rapidly <unk> and another mother .
Both women were raped and must continue to wait for them for <unk> injuries .
They arrested the attackers , but they were not charged with a court nor prison .
According to the Human Rights Index , a independent social media community in the country &apos;s Somali region has reported in 2015 in 2017 .
The real number of rape cases will be higher than a number of victims - from fear of <unk> , <unk> trust , <unk> trust and interest in the basic health sector .
Aside from the problems of law enforcement , the public health and lack of technology and lack of local equipment and medical equipment that will require more obstacles to <unk> sexual assault .
There is also no health services that can be impacted with rape .
indigenous culture can also be able to accept justice as a regional custom that they are marry or &quot; camels or livestock &quot; as compensation for the attack :
Rape are all around and remain in broad parts of Eastern Asia , there is a dispute between conflict that has been created a climate conflict , and institutions have weakened the law .
The tradition states that rape victims often carry a compensation - often camels or livestock - accept their attacker as part of a previous practice that leads to the war between rival tribes .
Small steps towards the right direction - but it &apos;s enough ?

However , it will take a long time until this draft bill of the parliament , the second head of parliament , decided to be elected as a law , and was passed .
Although the problem of the African government has been divided in recent years , sexual violence is still divided against women and children , sexual violence against women and children are growing on the rise .
Argentina Wants the Hours to Vote to Vote &apos; · Global Voices
The &apos; green <unk> &quot; - the name of the refusal to reinstate the legalizing committee - the Argentinian Congress .
Photo from the Facebook page of the National Campaign for a Right to &quot; legal , safe and &apos; legal , &quot; which has been widely shared online .
On June 13 , the lawmakers of parliament voted to legalize the Council of the Argentinian Congress on June 13 .
Officially , the debate has started in March - a historic milestone in the long struggle for the pro @-@ austerity rights in Argentina .
In the months of two months , both citizens and opponents were released in the presidential council .
Before the debate , the bill was adapted to win a number of words to win the votes of the vote .
For the most important changes , the ability for doctors to reject the doctors who refuse to reject themselves , however , are obligated to require medical practitioners , which agreed to be necessary .
In addition , women need the consent of their parents or their business .
Meanwhile , online and civil society groups have been protesting on the initiative &apos;s initiative and civil society groups in the National Campaign for a right to promote a legal , safe and free hijab with green <unk> in the National Assembly .
Their message is &quot; trying to have a choice to have a choice ; to avoid abortion , &quot; legal abortion to prevent deaths . &quot;
At the same time , various religious organisations and <unk> were also held under &quot; the two lives &quot; against the law .
A vigil in front of the Congress was planned for June 13 , while inside the Lower Council of parliament .
Different surveys show that large parts of the population support the bill .
renowned journalist Eduardo Mokryakov , a respectable journalist , has been an unexpected survey , but was picked up on Twitter , but also disagreed with the results :
&quot; Watch : Are you for or against legal , safe and free of abortion ? &quot;
The analysis of the lawmakers &apos;s analysis , however , is currently a large majority of the lawmakers , however , a majority against the decriminalization .
However , in many cases , however , it is still unclear how legislators are voting to vote , either because the lawmakers don &apos;t have to be elected or because they don &apos;t really have their belief for pressure or threats .
The last day of the official debate was highlighted by a powerful speech by Ministry of Health in Northern Algeria , who emphasizes the decriminalization :
We have been living in a democratic democracy since 35 years .
Abortion is a matter of being seen under the weather .
The evidence is clearly : the failure of less infected and less abortion .
In some ways , the way to act .
If the proposed draft bill will be adopted , he will be introduced by the Senate , where it is a clear majority against the decriminalization .
However , this trend could change , but depending on what the result of the debate is a key deal in terms of fraud cuts , where the members of the country &apos;s marginalized members .
&quot; I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf that looks at the Congress &quot;
It is impossible to ignore the impact of public opinion in the polls , but also in various personal stories that will be shared online .
In one of them , a woman reporting on the legal and economic obstacles that they faced when she faced a medical order of abortion .
She calls the names of the doctors , but she describes how some refused to help her , who refused to help her , and how a doctor demanded for the intervention :
My head and my body didn &apos;t quit .
I felt the same fear , when I got out of the help and medical supplies of medical supplies and the doctors I needed to make the leap in the <unk> .
When I was sleeping every time , I had to think every time of Dr. N. and Dr. B. i has to think about Dr. B , especially after I saw him for his life .
She concludes :
I feel that I have much harm in the past few days .
I have a pair of friends who <unk> me , even one of many women with a green scarf that is one of many women with a green scarf that would vote in Congress and asks him to go to the legalize of voting .
On Twitter , users have expressed themselves on the issue and diverse opinions of the bill :
The UN has defined the criminalization of abortion as a leader .
If the bill will not be adopted , all parliamentarians voted against these torture and the potential deaths .
They will be a single woman who drowned in your conscience .
Abortion is passed , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just in rape , if not , &quot; he says , &quot; did it mean that it &apos;s not about the legs , &quot; he says .
Targeted or illegal abortion , it &apos;s the question here .
If approved by the law , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America that offends the global trend .
The first country in the region that made this step was in 2012 .
As a result , the <unk> was pushed up in the most violent state of Latin America .
Let &apos;s be the country we want .
A country without corruption that is addicted to the world in the world , with a healthy low @-@ scale country , social dialogue , and legal failure .

They are a bit of bread , and we kept a bit of bread , and then we insist in a sense that you could be dead , or even beyond the death .
The cover is the next three days ; every single small detail continued .
On the 4th day , once again , once again , one day old <unk> will not be heard .
It is harder to be in jail .
The days are hard , the nights .
And the darkness only .
Even if you are not tortured , the car is getting worse enough .
Have they forgotten about us ?
Are we the rest of our life here ?
Why did we not be <unk> today ?
Have they discovered the cell phone ?
Such questions about questions that you care about the head .
The day continues .
Every days , the appalling odor for blood and <unk> , which <unk> you around you all over .
You don &apos;t imagine each other at the bodies of the other detainees and the <unk> walls .
How he feels all this .
The fifth day of running on the evening .
The guards opens the door and call for : &quot; Nu Pogodi <unk> ! &quot; I leave the cell and <unk> me the clean face that they can take care of it and beat me back .
I cross the door to a space in my head , similar to the previous day .
&quot; On the knees , I follow the order of the order .
The conversation is inspired by the <unk> of a <unk> on paper ; a more person is now in the room . &quot; Ah , Sarmad alone .
You really want to be good enough to see better than your age , and if you are actually a doctor , you can be just a man &apos;s son .
Why just do you <unk> a weapon with you ? &quot;
He starts with a criminal case for non @-@ corruption crimes , hoping that I &apos;m at least participating in demonstrations .
I never had no one , and I don &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; a wake @-@ up from it and I am walking with the body .
Prakash , like a third person , standing on me and threw his knees down with my shoulders . &quot; Wo @-@ <unk> <unk> with respect if you want to respect you , &quot; he tries to respect his image .
The comuniqué continues : &quot; Listen to , Sarmad , you can really tell us all of us .
We even bring you a distant tea .
I want to believe that you don &apos;t want to be a weapon with you .
But <unk> , you tell us that you will join the demonstrations , then we &apos;ll be cool , &quot; but the person at me , &quot; I &apos;ve got surprised and I still do it , &quot; he says , and I &apos;m still doing it .
&quot; In order to make it , Sarmad , do we hear this , &quot; he says .
We don &apos;t accuse anyone unfair .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Madhukar , &quot; a thought dressed in my head : You always say Al Zadjali &apos;s blog .
Then this can be a <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of the speeches .
He begins to talk to the only language that he understood , and <unk> <unk> on me , with just a few short <unk> .
Until he finally destroyed its coastal heritage , I guess .
I return to my cell back to my cell .
A satellite is necessary to let me get .
Since the first hearing I felt , I felt as a state of <unk> in his sector .
With the head and fragile hands , we hands the same path to see the same direction .
The same number of voices <unk> from the walls .
I <unk> down my breath , but my breath is not true because I can &apos;t stop , &quot; If you cannot stop , better better to breathe !
Or if you want to be <unk> ?
I <unk> slowly and sound as soon as I can only get out .
I am shaking - afraid of fear or cold ?
Ah , how else does you do so , or so hear my teeth not to <unk> . &quot; So well , Sarmad &apos;s <unk> ?
Then I can go home and release you to go home .
Who filming you ?
How did you manage to allow the material permit on TV stations ?
Is there anything we don &apos;t know ?
I mean all of us , but I &apos;d still hear it from your mouth . &quot;
No time to reflect ; ever again , the fewer doubt that the fewer doubt they don &apos;t let them .
I could have done everything and say that I have nothing done .
I believe they are doing this country , &quot; he says , &quot; You see my eyes . &quot;
I &apos;m sure you can see you to see you now .
Get to me , Sarmad , you are still young and your whole future .
We can all open the doors before the nose , we can also open the thousands of doors .
The decision is with you , and join this mobile phone here ; get you on Facebook or in this Yahoo , or where you are going to tell your videos , and where you are going to tell you , and tell me that we can be able to get here . &quot;
At that moment , every single sentence would be made through the head that the other prisoners were told by their friends .
That value of your life is tied with people around you .
You want to hold the beneficiaries - who can no longer be able to take part in danger , and who can be sacrificed if there is no other else ?
My mother often spoke of &quot; tea you don &apos;t even want to be a non @-@ enemy enemy , &quot; which I &apos;m going to see , and I would really want to give it to the throat .
&quot; I use my email account only for ordinary ordinary .
Well , please , I &apos;m responding to me . &quot; After several <unk> on my neck , I have used the wrong <unk> ( I have used a false account for such situations ) , <unk> the third attempt .
Online web websites , online sites and dozens of online forums .
Nothing of them , &quot; don &apos;t you care about a <unk> user or what ?
You may not understand what &apos;s &apos; <unk> &apos; , what ?
No problem . &quot;
He pains the eyes of the table , making me care of his table and leaves the room .
A minutes later , without any kind of conscience , there is no <unk> , no <unk> I remember life from the life .
Then the knees go back . &quot; The voice is different .
He <unk> me in a skirt and starts me .
To fall away from my feet .
The screams break away from me .
He continues , moving forward with me to <unk> a <unk> @-@ <unk> water <unk> .
That &apos;s how hours goes on for hours , and I can hear how he had a drink , he &apos;s succeeded .
It smells for cigarettes ; as in the space where we are not allowed , he expresses the <unk> on my back .
I &apos;m exhausted , and he <unk> me - among the reasons I can keep without help .
After many attempts , it &apos;s going back to my cell and I got back to my cell .
I stand immediately in bitter .
This is just a <unk> system of a <unk> system where to think about crimes and the thinkers of the criminals who are involved in prison .
It is a system that aims to refer to the illusion of freedom of freedom - one of the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship because they felt truth .
Sarmad you not can &apos;t sleep all day , you have to stand up and wash her . &quot;
Apparently I didn &apos;t have to read until the short moment in which you were talking about the <unk> <unk> until the evening , until the evening of the next day , they have come to buy you elsewhere or they &apos;ll be free .
Like all other , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from <unk> , is one of the few elements here .
His smile never leaves his face when he talking with the other .
He worked in the yurt @-@ year prison factory , and the opportunity to read a lot of books .
During a fire , several banned books were discovered by him - and some pictures he was seen as a protester .
The reason enough to arrest him .
There are a few new detainees next day .
All of them talk about a certain person near a suitcase near our suitcase . &quot; They had to shoot him in the leg to arrest him .
And then he &apos;s a knife with a knife , and they &apos;ve done the lives of life , &quot; one of the <unk> , especially the <unk> of <unk> strength .
He continues : &quot; He is big and strong , he was growing . &quot;
Another hours a few hours to be called fair .
We all <unk> all of us as much as possible to find a look at him , a <unk> of young man , a <unk> @-@ young man , who wears his legs to his legs , who is wearing <unk> by the bullet destroyed and on his neck .
The guards are afraid of him !
They take him to the camp .
We &apos;re in silence in silence in silence , hoping to hear everything what it somehow happened .
Nothing !
We remember our routine , <unk> fate .
Safer than they were brought into the church .
Time passes without one word .
Every way , everyone will do with his previous lives , so they do not have a choice , when there are nothing to do when there are nothing to live idle and time ?
The door on the <unk> will be <unk> .
The steps of the vote gets closer .
Our cell is open and <unk> .
The door continues again .
We wait until the guards are continuing and wash wounds , <unk> wounds .
If we are staying in these distant countries in these distant countries , we &apos;ve been gathering around the fires and would be protected , even protected by those .
But here as a human <unk> you &apos;re talking to the series ; either <unk> you to wear her wounds or her .
As a hour , it has already passed through consciousness now , and after a few minutes , he can also make it too .
Then he hands his hand into the <unk> !
This is more than a window of a window ; only the guards and his <unk> use him .
None of us had so close to us .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a pretty brave young person , and I have a lot of women in the nose .
Can it be that your sister was among them ?
Do you like evil for me ?
Or did you know about your ass , and you have since been on my blood ?
If you just say what we say , we would be able to settle the whole peaceful act .
No reason to you all anger . &quot;
smile and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of the others from their <unk> , so , and I &apos;m also sure I was almost sure , &quot; We just live , and we just have a God .
We knew from the beginning that we could die .
Then we drove them earlier at least one .
Or believes that these killers kill us around us only for other people because we are afraid of them ?
Oh <unk> - they have more afraid of us than we were . &quot;
He looks like to hear the guards .
Three of them beat the door and duties in the cell .
They beat the <unk> of <unk> and organizing him from outside .
It should be the last time I see in military training training training .
In a number of students , a number of people can draw attention to injustice and human rights violations in their country , the shooting of a unarmed young young person .
The image is dedicated to the killing of thousands of people , including youth groups .
These killings are committed by masked individuals who are allegedly linked to police and other state security forces .

The group , which was passed in January this year , is scheduled to regulate commercial activities and regulate business activities , including the collection of books .
The controversial regulations generated rules within the cultural sector and demand that those who provide staff to provide telecommunications services to the official institutions .
Moreover , charges that will be applied with the requirements of the requirements , with the authorities who have the right to claim .
In addition to the decree , they can also include the application of fines , and use tools , tools and use of tools that were used for the animal activities .
The global event is also allowed to start immediate effect .
The controversial nature of the norm is also in one of the articles that &quot; the dignity of people &quot; violated the minds of the people .
Thus , discrimination is punishable by the origin of the origin or sexual orientation , and as well as violent images of crimes in the cultural sector .
Many of the decree &apos;s opponents are free of the case of the case and preventing them the reach of artistic news parties .
One of the most important arguments is that these myths are the ability to open the possibilities of independent artists and the door to open standards and censorship that the government is complacent .
The campaign for the decree of the decree was met with discussions about a new constitution for the country &apos;s new constitution .
However , many believe that the discussions of the protests against the decree have committed against the decree .
In the midst of the discussion , a group of intellectuals , artists and activists launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s Facebook page :
Environmental science and David are also involved in the project .
The campaign is trying to collect 10,000 signatures ; this is the case in the Cuban constitution to reach a legal norm .
Meanwhile , a petition and an open letter , which has been divided on bloggers , have joined the legitimacy of the norm .
In the text , the undersigned expressed their concern for the art and culture in Cuba about the coming years , if the state authorities will be able to compete with the permission to carry the permit and who fund them :
Today , mobile phone footage offers a number of new sources of support for the artistic projects .
The fact that Cuba is making its work through its means to fund its work , doesn &apos;t make it to a brand of people using the new technologies to spread their work on the brink of the platform .
It also identified the risks that <unk> with further legal criteria within the decree , such as the punishment of &quot; sensationalist content on ethical and cultural values . &quot;
The open letter is about the president of Cuba , Miguel Díaz , and the new act of film and intellectuals like Oswaldo Alonso , and was signed with artists and intellectuals like <unk> <unk> , candy Nuñez , and Enrique del Cruz .
The concerns of the letter will be shared by the organization &apos;s permission :
The independent artists or those who have no connection with state institutions or groups of civil society are doubly discrimination because of what the kind of expression and means of expression is a protest in the state .
Additionally , questions related to this norm in religious domains where development activities are taking place .
This is known in the <unk> de <unk> ( also known as PM10 ) , a far @-@ divided religion in Cuba , where both dance and music is part of a rituals .
At the same time , a hip hop song accompanied the various protests , which featured in collaboration with artists like David D ad from artists like David D ad , entitled &quot; para @-@ gowns &quot; and &quot; para Serious Pollution &quot;
Your censorship shows the closing of concerts .
They have always been doing it .
You &apos;re hoping to tell us the arts .
What were you doing when you were in the Constitution of sanctions against artists ?
Enough with the growing oppression .
Shamsheer has Jorge Angel Hernández Hernández Hernández Segura at the event in the magazine La Nación :
The government &apos;s reactions to the decree will take place closely with the depiction of a future chaos by censorship and repression ; they declare the swiftness and protect them , without a large number of cases that enable them to take part in various levels of the international audience .

Respect respect for this lady .
In comparison , I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;

There is a sense of the economic crisis in Venezuela that is not spoken to the language : what impact them on women and children .
With 44 % of the families in the country , the women who <unk> a woman &apos;s <unk> , are those who suffer from the long lines for the long millennium who suffer from the long @-@ <unk> health system when their loved ones are crying , when their loved ones are crying , when their relatives are sick .
Although the government has tried to curb the poverty of women , many other aspects of women &apos;s independence , many other aspects of the government &apos;s independence is not known as &quot; <unk> &quot; by the government .
For instance , for instance , the <unk> of the slum , according to Geoff del Barrio del Perú , has been a crucial wave of extreme poverty since 2006 , and all of the daughters of Venezuela , have been a crucial factor in extreme poverty .
Together both programs between 150 and 350 dollars depend on the number of children .
On the other hand , abortion in the country &apos;s inner constitution were considered illegal ; a heritage of previous political order , the country &apos;s main policies of the country &apos;s political needs .
Neither Chávez has made the opportunity to catch it up in the 20 years of her mandate .
Abortion is only allowed when the mother &apos;s life is in danger .
Mohmmad Voice , a well @-@ known feminist voice on the internet and co @-@ founded Global Voices , points out the <unk> rhetoric on gender equality :
... in Venezuela , the &apos; feminism &apos; of the power is consumed by the power , and mainly <unk> .
While you spoke about the historical character of politics , President Nicolás Maduro used to punish minorities on the decline in the executive , which are exposed to the majority of the <unk> in the executive , which are suffering from a situation that keeps their identity on the continent &apos;s identity .
They have not only been able to solve problems with the development of economic crisis .

Venezuelan Observatory of Violence ( Observatorio ) de la Gives ( <unk> <unk> de <unk> ) , which is a different method , referred to a different way of 89 to the country with most people in the world .
Also in July , 2015 , 40 % of the crimes in Caracas were perpetrated by police officers .
Police and violence has increased in recent years , and many women have to complain of the death of their children .
In La Paulo de <unk> ( Life of us ) , a project of media sharing personal information on the crisis , <unk> <unk> comments on the murder of her two children :
After about half hours , they called me to tell me that I should follow my children .
My heart wanted to jump from the shoulders when I saw her and I was .
Our <unk> was so unbelievably .
We &apos;ve watched us this kind of kind !
They didn &apos;t have a shirt and no shoes she told me my life .
The story has repeated repeatedly : They got a child .
Furthermore , the lack of proper medicine is often highlighted by sexual harassment in the school , with lack of proper medicine in the country with a shortage of medicines in the country .
Meanwhile , researchers , researcher at the Centre of Central Central Australia , explains :
... there is a <unk> , small but very important , of mothers in the <unk> it is a vicious cycle .
Many of the young men are not being carried out .
After that , they die from eight months in the hospital and those who survive survive , come back to a child without the support of their parents .
Ultimately , women who leave the country are confronted with difficulties .
The number of women &apos;s rape victims have been evaluated in Latin America and Europe , between 2014 and 2018 .
In neighbouring Colombia , more than one million Venezuelans recorded the women &apos;s prejudices and abuse .
Many accuse of the Venezuelan migrants to be able to &quot; steal &quot; and be involved in crimes , and women are regarded as sex workers .

Perhaps conclusions that the group was originally known as a neo @-@ <unk> singer , known as an Arab term , a Arab term that means &quot; followers of the <unk> tradition and <unk> , &quot; and the local communities based in the local communities .

The group aims to express themselves from socially marginalized , without formal employment and education .
Although religious roots had been religious and propaganda , those who have been exposed to the influence of the deadly values of Islam , they had not been the occupation of Cabo Delgado or the establishment of an Islamic State in the north of the country .
This distinction is confirmed by the police &apos;s depiction of the police .
The people had said to have chosen to integrate the group as they were promised to integrate down the fossil fuels .
The study also shows that the goal is to create illegal fishing systems in the region , including the trade with wood , <unk> , chemicals , and <unk> .

Talking is a young activist and tech engineer based on Facebook with &quot; <unk> a agenda for sexual diversity in Cuba &quot; ( <unk> on agenda for Internet diversity in Cuba ) , a space for conversations and discussion created almost 150 members .
He started working as a human rights activist for his experiences as a human rights activist for peace and gender rights for the National Center for Development ( Mwatana ) .
Two years , he worked at the University of computers in downtown Havana , a project that works on sexual health and rights , and &quot; Love at a Second Person &quot; ( Love on the Second View ) .
In 2014 , he was here to participate in Latin America and the Caribbean Department of the Sixth Island of the International Lesbian Human Rights Committee of the International Lesbian Human Rights Committee , writing articles and outreach Association ( global global activists ) .
He is now a member of the <unk> of Oscar Romero , where he works with young people working to use social equality .
In Cuba , the current debate is the current debate in Cuba for all that is not recognized by the country &apos;s constitution .
In our conversation , many interesting aspects of the debate has been addressed , from the level of meaning that people &apos;s marriage for all the lesbian lesbian , gay , transgender , transgender , transgender , transgender and intersex ( <unk> ) communities to regulate society &apos;s use of citizens .
Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should people be able to legalize themselves in Cuba in your opinion ?
Harmany <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think it should be a legal alternative should be given legal .
Especially because many legal events , including those who are disillusioned by female intellectual property property , is likely to highlight the relationship between intellectual property and the law .
Like this label , it &apos;s marriage for anyone , <unk> or something else , will depend on what our revolutionaries are driven and our ability to overcome us .
In the international level , there are several countries where it is legal .
In Cuba , we don &apos;t have the first step .
I don &apos;t believe that a legal plea to emotional stability of a relationship , but can be guaranteed , but can help protect the heritage of the problem , which is wrong to avoid labels .
The issue of the legal law that allows same @-@ sex couples to adoption up .
It &apos;s a matter that only a few people speak in Cuba .
It is complicated and not free of ethical questions .
GV : Do you think a national election will be necessary to determine whether long @-@ sex partnerships between people in Cuba should be allowed ?
MmeCoquelicot : I personally believe that the people of the people should not be exposed , not even the majority .
However , there are some legal procedures that can &apos;t be left out .
For example , marriage in the Cuban Constitution ( Article 36 ) is defined as a &quot; voluntary volunteer volunteer between a man and a woman who is legally allowed to get married to live . &quot;
The <unk> user <unk> communities .
Some of the greatest adjustments could be legal , for recognition of recognition for recognition , which is not the requirement for a formal vote .
This second option seems to be the norm , but it &apos;s only a limited reach .
If they are going to increase , marriage would still be a proper right / privilege for women &apos;s gender @-@ based gender or linguistic community .
But I should argue that a <unk> between people from the same gender is just one point in the agenda of sexual diversity .
That &apos;s why I should be discussed in the point of any legal initiative , and the agenda of <unk> deals among activists and organizations .
In terms of marriage , <unk> said :
I think it &apos;s hard to find oneself deep .
With regards to the story , marriage is an instrument of creating <unk> , <unk> and Shia Christian standards .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give her a chance , but I believe the debate has not reached the debate they should have .
That &apos;s why I would like to ask questions about future debates for future debates :
Why is the equality of marriage in so many times ?
What is it possible for the agenda of the sexual diversity ?
Does it make sense to fight marriage only because they have the right ?
What is the real <unk> of this legal act ?
If we talk about recognition of marriage rights , this is only the relationship between two people ?
What happens to the balance of life ?
Should you choose to be <unk> ?
What will affect the marriage for people who need to access the access to medicine and <unk> priority ?
Will marriage make changes for a lesbian woman who wants to support child marriage in Cuba ?
Because the Journal of public health is not sufficient for unknown couples , it would not be sufficient enough to be married by marriage because it is a part of the couple .
GV : Is you a case or <unk> in Cuba where people learned about not a universal partnership ?
Unbelievable : I are many cases .
One of them affects a friend who has been held by his partner of his partner .
It &apos;s a sad story .
Years ago , the father of the deceased was escorted from the house .
After his death , this father was almost all possessions of his son .
Since the community was not recognized , it wasn &apos;t like no legal situation .
In addition , there are numerous common ( restaurants , hotels , and other towns ) , emergencies and other towns , specifically sex couples .
GV : After four years ago , a commenter was left at a post of the newspaper proclaimed Mexican Communist Party ( Commission of the Chinese Party ) : &quot; The marriage for everyone is in the following comment , and it would be a way that it is the recognition of contracts of contracts and animals , as it is recognition of contracts .
It should not be legal because it &apos;s not normal .
There is couples trying to spend their entire lives without knowing something they do not fight ? &quot;
How would you respond to a mindset ?
Rykov : By all , I want to highlight that the comment , which shows it , was being published by an article which was published on May 6 , 2014 .
In an article written by the journalist RusVesna.su , a journalist at the time of the International Lesbian Secretary @-@ Secretary @-@ Secretary @-@ Secretary of International Lesbian University , Minh Ward , has garnered an overview of the International Lesbian Association of Human Rights .
Direct comments reflects the personal opinion of someone who openly returns to marriage for all .
It is his opinion , and I respect her great ignorance about the matter .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is the exact idea of how the tractor itself is .
What is a normal and natural course of course , it is not for the other and vice .
It has been a long time since the day of the story .
During the time of slavery , the term is a &quot; normal &quot; people as &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course , &quot; something that is <unk> the removal of the <unk> .
When I &apos;m fully convinced I am completely convinced , the love we are making each other , as legitimate as the love of love people who explain each other .

The next 48 hours are crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court urged the government to resign in a constitutional verdict , Colombian lawyers , and the work of his work as the leader of the United Nations Commission of Justice ( AFSC in charge of the United Nations Commission of Guatemala , short <unk> <unk> la <unk> ) to allow the impunity of the United Nations Commission .
Last month , Guatemala &apos;s president Jimmy Morales announced the mandate of <unk> and tribulations of the United States , who is currently in the United States to refuse Guatemala .
The decision has sparked both national and internationally indignation and protests and protest protests .
Earlier this year , the Commission and members of his family were accused of corruption , but the <unk> of illegal <unk> in the room , and by Ghani &apos;s Dmitri Ghani , has now responded to the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not just a test test for the democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors that have supported the President in the past .
According to a official government agency , Morales could require Morales to ensure that legal action will lead to the president &apos;s ouster .
On social media , journalists like Nina creativo and other commenters have commented on social media , especially if Morales would refuse to demand the ruling and support the army :
Guatemala : The Council of the Constitutional Court is withdrawn .
This is not seen / in the sense of the constitution , it is not possible to ignore the President @ <unk> against President @ <unk> .
What will he be doing and its network of elites ?
Does the constitution be paid or <unk> ?
According to human rights activists , many of the soldiers responded with relief and fragile , but also with concern the government &apos;s next steps :
Sign news of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It had to come .
The <unk> Constitutional Court gives public order again .
What could happen in the next 48 hours when voting can return to Guatemala ?
A political style bias ?
Faced with the long and tough struggle against corruption and the political turmoil in the past few months in Guatemala , these events have a special meaning .
As a result , political <unk> by Morales after a peaceful outcry against corruption and impunity , the resignation of the political class commission Pérez Molina , and the resignation of the former president Otto Pérez Molina .
In the political crisis , the Commission &apos;s presence and its investigation was also an important role in the government &apos;s political crisis , which is expected by Morales to step down .
Now where Morales even stands in the decline of political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment in which Guatemala is either a major step on the protection of its democratic institutions .
Salvadoran journalist Héctor Silva refers to the reasons between Morales &quot; Minister of Justice &apos; and Morales &apos; Morales &apos; :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala with support for a large group of popular groups , including some links to the military station .
When he took , he said he was neither a thief nor a thief .
Today , he is a president who is driven by <unk> power to prevent corruption against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # <unk> ( &quot; resignation &quot; ) which has been used during the protests , which was used during the protests in 2015 again , will be held on the street .
At the same time , international media outlets have also highlighted the importance of the crisis in Guatemala , like the Colombian newspaper El Universo , and called the international community to track more developments in the country :
Whether the situation shows the tension that exists in this country , the situation has made a sore point , and no doubt is needed to deal with the issue without <unk> .
This is why the international community must have to protect the people of Guatemala to protect institutions and the search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be at Guatemala &apos;s <unk> , which would be a big impact on the history of a whole family that would have a similar impact on the story of a whole family .
Are this the last <unk> <unk> in <unk> ?

In the north of the northern <unk> in western India , the community is preparing a peaceful and good life .
From the hills there resounds the Echo of songs that have flourished for any work .
They are no average villagers that live in the same space , and an inch source .
They are rather unhappy with how their name suggests , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; can be translated roughly and &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of the <unk> . &quot;
During the past generations , however , the price of a non @-@ land <unk> that could be lost in the near future : the <unk> of <unk> .
The research industry in Sikkim saw many challenges how climate change , <unk> , a lack of infrastructure , economic infrastructure , and the <unk> of a dispatch in a city .
Since the 1960s , when porous borders have been closed , these challenges have increased .
Adding to the life of a <unk> campaign is a terrible fight , with the results that the number of people who are willing to take their traditional lives are constantly prevalent .
Before 1962 marked the year of 1962 , each year in 1962 , where they first walked into the northern areas of <unk> to <unk> their loans .
While <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in Tibet near <unk> <unk> in Tibet , where the grass and <unk> was <unk> and not through the weight of the weight of the weight .
In summer , she moved south to the southern region of the northern city of Sikkim and remained in areas such as golf metals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and smiles .
There were the <unk> of the laughter of the <unk> valley with the lack of <unk> , not only economically and culturally culturally for both parties .
The trade was established in cultural exchange and <unk> the peaceful exercise of the two communities .
In exchange , carbon blossoms are <unk> to drop off their cattle , depending on the <unk> of their own , <unk> , <unk> , and by livestock .
This exchange of exchange has been hampered by the agreement between Tibet and India , as well as the open borders that they couldn &apos;t operate .
Following the occupation of China , the border closed and the border was forced to relocate in 1962 .
Since then , it has been limited to a region , both in winter and in summer .
Dr. Anna violins , the <unk> of the Instituto Institute for Freeway Institute for Freeway Policy in Sikkim , told that the lawmakers realize that the claim that there were about 1,000 <unk> that would ensure the annual amount of interest in this year &apos;s annual economy .
Currently , there are still fewer than 12 families who lead the traditional lives of the land .
Other members of the community have found other jobs and most have tried to relocate themselves in smaller towns or larger towns .

Instead of hunting
The traditional way of life is not easy to be easy .
With their analysis on the state of Sikkim , they are exposed to the <unk> of weather conditions in the northern areas of South Africa , where there are more heavy snowfall in the northern areas that <unk> green <unk> .
&quot; If it comes , it is very difficult to make it very difficult for the animals like us , &quot; explained Wong in a film of the Croatian Institute for the School of Northern Sikkim , the <unk> of North @-@ <unk> <unk> .
The water boom is an increase in the water sector , but also heat is becoming growing .
According to MaktoobBlog , the average temperature is increasing in <unk> annually around 2.5 degrees .
This has led to a <unk> of <unk> , and the heat is preparing to take advantage of the amount of basic complaints .
The red animals will be a burden on a burden on the <unk> and they are forced to sell them either .
This means an additional window to buy the <unk> .
For the traditional <unk> community , this is relatively new business , so so far put the root risks of their daily demand and newborn supplies .
Since the season , the community has also been able to leave the army when they have been exposed to open sources of medical aid , although the army is unable to afford any help .
In such cases , the simple survival is sensitive .
To understand the manipulation of <unk> , you need to make a key role in the way of life in the Kichwa community , and they are offered milk and milk to the variety of products , as a shelter for sale on sale as a weapon .
In the roundabout , things like <unk> , clothes , and <unk> .
During previous times , expensive <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , mainly in Tibet and served as a technocrat .
Due to the payment crisis , a large of trade is suspended .
The milk market will be mostly known for tea - in the area of Chai - in the area of Chai - and in the summer of the summer .
Having been a rare pension of power , the Commonwealth is typically sold in the places where a businessman has become a baby living in the field .
After all these years , the product will still be seen as guests and not seen as residents of the area .
They are trapped and have to make it <unk> , not only because their herds are <unk> , but also because they <unk> the rules and regulations of the <unk> communities .

Yet , despite all of this movement , there are some <unk> to a living for a living .
They <unk> the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> valley , and they care for more than the army &apos;s <unk> .
In addition to <unk> , food , food , food , and other <unk> , many have to wear the cost of their children if they have decided to wear their children to schools in cities .
After their education and urban life , the children are used to return to the children , and the children are often going to return with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and &quot; if everything is <unk> , life as a <unk> , &quot; says Dr. Anna Krenz .
Young men also allege that because they could not find a bride because they could not find a bride .
Those who back the profession to honour the country is often in the army , the government or other urban work work .
With the latest rise in tourism in tourism in the latest world , jobs are also asked .
Those who don &apos;t find their work , get the last way in the Tibetan cold .
None of the government &apos;s government support the interest of some non @-@ Malay non @-@ profit organizations are sufficient for young people to continue the traditional way of life .
Despite all this , there are those who have <unk> the traditional life and life of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
But even they are keeping the deep conditions of conditions , acknowledge that their children would choose to obtain their livestock in cities and other jobs .
This is a generation that could easily write the last chapter in the history of <unk> in <unk> .

Ali Zriouli was 21 years old when he reached a boat in July 2013 to promote environmental radio projects .
After 6 months of existence , he was transferred to the Sri Lankan refugee camp in Papua New Guinea , where he should spend the next four years in his life .
On Papua International , he emerged on cartoons to expose the <unk> of his <unk> by the situation and other asylum seekers in the camp .
He took the most inexperienced &quot; inexperienced seeds &quot; ( villages of fish ) , who was spared in the high @-@ high lake in 2013 .
After almost three years imprisonment , media outlets started posting their cartoons showing the constitution of refugees on Manus .
Some of the cartoons expressed his own health and sexual abuse that he learned in the camp .
In 2016 , he was awarded his work from the Investigative Rights Network for his work from the Angolan Rights Network ( International Network for Memory ) .
The reason for his award reads : &quot; Its cartoons will be seen as an important contribution from <unk> of the worst human behavior &quot; since the World War II .
Australia has been criticized from all over the world due to the conditions of the refugee conditions in the refugee camp .
The United Nations has declared the political line for serving a &quot; cruel , inhumane and degrading punishment . &quot;
Ali was released in December 2017 after a worldwide campaign for his release .
On December 17 , 2013 , he was seized in Norway by the International Cities of Indigenous Network ( International Island ) .
On e @-@ mail , we evacuated Ali almost a year after he left on the freedom as &quot; an exit to freedom . &quot;
He spoke about his life after his arrest , his experiences in the refugee camp , and asked advice for other artists who are persecuted .
Ali appearances , although he is happy with his new life in Norway , it was very difficult to adapt it .
After two weeks , I fell into a deep depression that was even more more stronger than the depression I suffered on Manus , and it took four months to talk with the help of a psychologists , and I started to build a new life with the help of a psychologists .
He remembers his decision to ask the cartoons after being sent to a medical employee that he was suggested to keep a medical activity , but it wasn &apos;t simply - the prisoners didn &apos;t just have access to paper and pen .
I was tied to stadiums until 2014 , and I had not had enough paper , not enough enough , and I had to steal the employees , and I had to steal for a little piece of paper , and I had to steal my cartoon to someone .
And that was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The arts has not helped me balance - but it has helped me to send my voice to people in the world outside the camp .
It was the arts who saved me , it was the arts who saved my life .
His photo drew the attention of medical workers and <unk> on the ground , first on sham stadiums , on Manus .
Later , Australian media has been reporting attention to his art on Manus :

I have asked for a five years for help and get them .
I have been given my freedom after I have been asking for five years for help .
To ask for help , it is not fair .
He also asks that he would provide a need to provide false information about the situation in the camp .
The truth has helped me .
The truth has helped me to get my freedom .
