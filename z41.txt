In different places , especially in West Africa , migration has been &quot; <unk> , &quot; like Grassi
There is a normal strategy of the migration to find work as a normal strategy in the country or migration .
Europe is therefore the target of migration .
KTEmoc writes
This travels often doesn &apos;t have any particular place .
You can stay at a time to work at a time to work and make money to work .
And then you will continue to continue and be another place for a few time .
Or you are deported from the country .
The whole thing is more important and more than the most basic way to Europe , when it comes to Europe .
Without work and opportunities , opportunities will be seen as the <unk> decision to leave home and seek to get a better perspective .
Just like a young person &apos;s decision to be a choice of dignity . &quot; They hope to do what a <unk> person is doing , for Rincón , and for their family .
Young people are often expected to be expected for their parents and other family members . &quot;
Judge agrees : &quot; It &apos;s about to improve the situation home .
As a result of the youth in Mali , narratives are experiencing narratives about his country .
There is a basic sense that will help the political system of youth . &quot;
To satisfy the young people who will be expected by them , they can take their jobs as a adults , they hope to hope outside of their country .
As long as the situation in their homeland , the young people will not change their way to other places .
&quot; It &apos;s OK . &quot;
In the words &quot; It &apos;s ok &quot; to leave the young Guineans in their country .
But who can , in the face of the <unk> , guarantee that the current situation is okay ?
Like many other campaigns from the EU , the video is only focusing on the accent to the accent that the young people are looking forward to their homeland .
&quot; If they want to stay home to the <unk> , they have some of the opportunity to stay in the fore , they would have to show some of them there . &quot;

Miguel had not been <unk> to 2015 .
At the age of 20 , he received the <unk> status .

In 2017 , he received work as a prayer in a basement , and the devices could use free to free them before the Maoist morning .
He is not the only one with this desire .
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990 , limits between the different states were established in numbers of people in numbers from a day on another day .
Through bureaucracy , economic conflicts or simply simply simply because documents from a recent era were not more elusive , they were to &quot; strangers . &quot;
In Georgia , thousands of people are living with the separatist conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and in recent years , Georgia tries to try to give back a sense of belonging .
After several years on the street with his mother , Miguel outnumbered was recorded in a musical street in Tbilisi , written by a religious organization .

The viral social media campaign # <unk> ( # <unk> , so far ) , forced China &apos;s most popular social media platform to re @-@ censorship .
However , this step doesn &apos;t mean that LGBT voices continue to silence online voices , but it demonstrates a significant bit of the Dene &apos;s reputation .
On April 13 , Weibo plans to document a harsh crackdown on cartoons , Games and <unk> , and the plans are based on China &apos;s Android Law , the technical factors for the lifting of the state @-@ based security system .
It is no direct reference to LGBT content .
The company explained evidence that LGBT content would be affected , and had been removed from the subject , hundreds of thousands of gatherings , removed from thousands of thousands of policemen and <unk> <unk> .
On the next day , &quot; LGBT &quot; ( &quot; LGBT &quot; votes ) published a popular LGBT holiday , a popular LGBT reporter , a statement on Weibo :
Due to circumstances that lie outside of our control , the editorial work of LGBT Weibo is suspended indefinitely on Weibo .
During that time we will use our official Weibo account of LGBT <unk> not to release LGBT news .
I want to thank all the Weibo users who have been supporting us since 2009 .
Each comment , like and Share - is a voice for love .
Let &apos;s hope for a better morning .
The above above has been shared more than 31,000 times .
A large number of Weibo users started shortly after covering the news , using the hashtag # <unk> as a protest against censorship .
In less than 500 million calls for the hashtag , nearly 500 million views were used .
Protecting censors tried to stop the protest from <unk> , but not with the always ongoing users , and the foreign media that have now crossed the events .
Instead of public opinion , the newspaper People &apos;s Daily ( a official publication of the Chinese Communist Party ) published a memorandum on April 15 , which highlights the LGBT content that LGBT content should not be confused with disabilities , with disabilities , with disabilities .
On the next day and declared his statement , however , not a controversial act against LGBT content in the months of the three @-@ year @-@ old content law , but instead of censorship , pornographic of vulgar , pornographic or violent content .
The Weibo @-@ artist of LGBT Youth joined his activity on April 16 :
Thank many , thank you for your voice .
What is happening in the past 48 hours , proves that it &apos;s clean to climate change .
The editorial staff of @ LGBT <unk> can continue their work - thanks to 48 hours .
The hashtag # <unk> we started to use seven years ago , was called more than 500 million times .
He has been the most popular LGBT topic against discrimination in China , and has been using the hashtag # <unk> .
Within 48 hours in China , 10 hours outside China and the government and the pro @-@ government People &apos;s Daily People &apos;s Daily Party , the @ affair changed his decision , and will not focus more on the list of <unk> content in the list .
All this should go into history .
With you , the LGBT community will remain strong .
We will continue healthy , scientific and lack of LGBT content , so that the public can be a <unk> and inclusive understanding of our community .
This is the best way to offer discrimination .
LGBT rights advocates will remain a victory and the Chinese LGBT community .
However , this is only an obstacle which evicted from the road .
The <unk> <unk> was not an isolated case , nor it was a quick mistake of the company .
This led by the spread of spreading pressure .
LGBT content has already been on the focus of <unk> in recent years .
WeChat user @ Freedom @-@ 404 documented the following <unk> with LGBT content ( via China Digital Times ) :
March 2018 : A revelation of the award @-@ winning film headed by your name at the Beijing Film Festival was cancelled .
The film , which tells the love of a gay couple , won the Oscar shaping the best adapted script and was also nominated in the Best Film Film Film and Best nominated nominated .
In May 2017 , local cultural associations were inspired by the International Day Against Homophobia , Transphobia and Orzgan , but was forced to pull its show .
June 2017 : Online audio Service provider Association ( Less like VOIP Service ) published a policy that demands online content with sexual behavior such as <unk> , homosexuality , sexual acts , sexual abuse , sexual abuse , sexual abuse , and internet justice .
Soon , online platforms , including Zoomin.TV and Youku , attracts parts of their LGBT content .
July 2017 : As feminist researcher Li Jaffery , her voice for the LGBT community was blocked for three months .
July 2015 : A popular online piece , &quot; I mean to my parents ? &quot; · Global Voices
The official reason for the ban was that the guests had to &quot; <unk> &quot; sexual behavior to understanding &quot; sexual behavior and the morality . &quot;

His re @-@ use .
On Sunday , June 24 , the Turkish voters will go to the election of a new president , with five other candidates the duck and bold Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s Erdogan plan to be achieved .
While in this campaign the <unk> will fly in the third year of emergency declared in the third year of emergency declared on the massive decline of the state of emergency .
It should usually represent elections and visions of any particular candidate or a candidate or a particular party .
But this is the time that Turkish democracy will be challenged , and this election is very common , and this election is very common .
The country has been declared in a state of emergency in the state of emergency in July 2016 , which <unk> the government &apos;s government , according to the state @-@ backed government , according to Erdogan &apos;s arch @-@ nemesis .
President Erdogan , the candidate of the ruling party for justice and Development ( AKP ) , has been in power since 2002 , after being in power after being elected for more than a decade before he was elected to the president .
The two years after the failed registration system in July 2016 , there are a harsh appeal against political opposition , and even on social media , and even on social media posts .
The public service was also like the military , the military , the justice and science by the <unk> .
Wikipedia , the largest online encyclopedia of the world , is currently blocked within the country .
In this context , it is no surprise that Erdogan &apos;s export @-@ year @-@ old it is difficult to find out of nearly 60 million voters , including roughly 1.5 million new voters , including roughly 1.5 million new voters .
Erdogan is saying that the generous coverage that has received its campaign from the national network and other pro @-@ government mass media outlets under the current state of emergency .
&quot; For me , one example .
Where and the campaign has been blocked , &quot; he asked the state of emergency ? &quot; He asked this week in his home town in eastern Turkey .
He also suggested that the state of emergency could be suspended after the elections .
It is common that the most important president is meant to comply with President Erdogan &apos;s discourse .
However , his opponents quickly spread from him .
This exchange is not only an weird relief from a tense political atmosphere , but also an important insight into what is happening in this election for reviewing his three main opponents and Turkish voters .
Punish the refrigerator ?
Mr Erdogan &apos;s story know
The candidate Erdogan could be able to go through a <unk> of low @-@ plus miles from Istanbul , a city of 94 kilometres from Istanbul , in a second round .
In his speeches , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> his modest beginnings as a <unk> in his speeches , it has an additional attempt to disconnect itself from the Republican People &apos;s Party and the Association of the Republican People ( KKE ) .
Protest Ceremony in the campaign .
Taken from Instagram &apos;s official Instagram .
It is seen as a <unk> leader , but its result of the Kurdish female voters , where the <unk> was weak in the past remains weak .
Although he is not the national national <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> was impressive , especially the embarrassment of <unk> the <unk> for &quot; slip @-@ off &quot; and other <unk> .
In a prominent example , Erdogan used the growth of the annual petition in Turkey since the rule of AKP in Turkey as <unk> for the economic progress of its party .
Not time , not time and proposed , moving back to the Turkish word for refrigerator , reposts , Turkish Twitter :
Erdogan &apos;s Erdogan at a rally in Lucknow , a city of immigration movement , come from Istanbul , &quot; How many are sold in 2002 ( in 2002 ) ?
How much is the sale for sale since now ?
This means that ( the people not ) are poor .
Today , if there &apos;s a refrigerator , each household is - then the prosperity must be everywhere .
Erdogan &apos;s signature to Erdogan : The refrigerator has been for 40 years .
You are it that he got him !
The answer was important , as a majority of Erdogan &apos;s hope is based on a victory in the first round , how voters had his leadership in the <unk> economy .
In the past , the AKP of the Parties were among the political parties who are the core of the party &apos;s support , including the support of economy .
But while the pro @-@ independence GDP in Turkey according to the latest official statistics in the last 16 years , the political party has been vulnerable to the power of power in power , the economy is vulnerable to many fronts .
In the beginning of this year , the growing assessment of Turkish urination towards the US $ 290 has been regularly criticized for the following year as the party is making public funds in expensive development , while criticizing the far @-@ led corruption .
Turkic bird , the magnificent bird
Perhaps the next candidate of the elections in Turkey is Paxx Moll , the Ko chair and presidential candidate of the Kurdish Leftist Party ( <unk> ) , who led his campaign from a jail cell .
However , he worked on the hashtag # <unk> hashtag ( # <unk> ) , and works occasionally to achieve a tweet about his lawyers using the outside world .

Obviously , they could not find a tweet in the cell .
There was only one <unk> for the ( <unk> ) of tea and she <unk> that he could not be used to tweet .
It has become a symbol of freedom of speech that has become the symbol of freedom of speech in the social media sphere .

You have to have to be a <unk> , for example .
But no one has seen your watch .
I &apos;m able to comprehend them , they are their ( <unk> ) that are different .

Many activists from young activists were also effective online .
Recently , she recently visited Google &apos;s presidential palace to promote the &quot; AKP &quot; party in Erdogan &apos;s presidential palace , which included the words &quot; AKP &quot; or similar community , which is often considered <unk> <unk> .
Some are suspicious that <unk> are <unk> and not bite , and perhaps that it may be a chance for a political position if Erdogan needs to need nationalist support in parliament - like expected .
However , the only candidate of the equation is currently a different song .

Without paper , electricity and News : Censorship in Venezuela · Global Voices
Illustration by <unk> Eduardo <unk> &apos;s <unk> on the web censorship in Venezuela .

In the midst of protests against social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , state control has reached the state control of new media .
In June 2018 , Venezuelans were forced to take advantage of the world @-@ related services , pornographic websites and the Tor Tor application , and the latest measure of a growing strategy of spreading access to the general population .
The road was long and fighting .
As the government of the late President Hugo Chávez has started restrictions on Radio and television , with President Nicolás Maduro , many media outlets who have been caught previously in a business business where the state has been taken to the state and a commercial impact in which the state has been carried out .
Furthermore , the National Constituent Assembly approved the National Assembly ( ANC ) - which was held earlier in the presentation of the National Constituent Assembly - a controversial law that was introduced to regulate social media and every medium that &quot; hate &quot; or removed .
You believe that because of tweets , people have been arrested because of tweets , it seems that this regulation has already been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has caused a shortage of goods and basic services , such as paper , electricity and <unk> .
This shortage , in connection with political affairs and information , has strained a regulatory and heavily controlled situation , has been causing the communication of communication and spreading information .
Newspapers are online ... and will it blocked
With the rapid rise in <unk> due to the rapid rise of <unk> , local newspapers saw local newspapers ( especially the local newspapers ) to stop their spending on their daily basis or to keep them online .
As a result , a journalist tweeted :
It is reported that El Alto was blocked in different places from Venezuela .
I observed today that on my computer access to El Verdade , La bruja and other Venezuelan pages that are &quot; insulting &quot; the dictatorship .
Do others have the problem ?
An ad of police reports .
Months later , journalists , on Twitter , reported on Twitter and other media outlets that El Arabia was blocked , one of the most important newspapers in the country :
This is how El Representative is on the server : <unk>
&quot; It &apos;s not about <unk> , it &apos;s about the ban &quot;
Talks Sanhan , a organization supporting freedom of expression and access to information , condemned their Twitter account that CANTV has blocked the public web service , using sexual content such as OnlinePetition.ru and online content .
The measure placed the attention of public and social media .
Mariangel adds that the idea of the authoritarian opinion is to morality and arguments on them :
The question is to be raised here , how it could come to this point .
Anyone would say that Chavism is a regime that Chavism is a regime that is slowly safe in all sectors of society .
Those who try to move to him will be a full rule of society to be achieved .
Other users quickly started the real scope of the measure and their close use of Internet censorship - an ongoing concern not only in Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main problem is not only about the blocking of pornographic sites , what is already a disaster , but that the block will spread to other sides .
What are they doing blocking porn ?
They do the blocking of other sides , next will be YouTube .
However , other users argue that it wasn &apos;t about to censorship .
They are assisting broadband Internet and the control of the problem :
Whilst the blocking of porn sites is neither nor <unk> , she has been created because the government wants to protect children .
The reason for Venezuela is not money to pay the bandwidth to pay bandwidth to the entire amount of Internet access .
What alternatives are there ?
Maybe Tor help ... or not
Tor is an free software that is used to be used in the web to be anonymous , and so many allows the Internet to use it to use the Internet .
The ban on the Tor network of Tor , however , seems intangible and is not effectively effective .
Yet , organizations like Acceso Libre or <unk> Sin confirms that Tor was blocked .
They draw out solutions to stop the restrictions :
We can confirm that Tor ( in direct connections ) is blocked @ <unk> , you can use it with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
It is reported by blocking of @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To bypass censorship , you can use bridges and Tor so <unk> :
In contrast , the context of the context and history is dark .
Many Venezuelans are asking what media or <unk> will be censored , and what can be done to be done to the government &apos;s actions .

I am a staunch supporter of the military officer ; it &apos;s far from traveling to learning and gather new experiences .
This belief is both known for both self @-@ centered and intellectual .
So when the opportunity for a temporary temporary temporary organization is not allowed to apply for a significant international non @-@ profit organization ( National NGO ) , I made my suitcase and made me back to Europe .
It wasn &apos;t about the big money that we have always been told , there would be expected to be the salary .
This is what no one is prepared to be prepared , and the rare display of an institution is what it means is <unk> in an institution that is led by a white majority .
He was raised in Uganda and mostly in the African region of the Big lakes of the Big lakes , I had no idea what it would mean .
Even though I was familiar with the <unk> in Africa in Africa , as well as the <unk> of the Democratic Republic of Congo , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo in its movie &quot; Puede , &quot; I wrote about the experience of a minority .
Since the revelations of Oxfam in Haiti , the international NGO staff paid women for sex , in the past few months , there has been a few blockades in the past few months .
Following the riots riots and some other media outlets in international media outlets , Angela Bruce Certificates , who has received attention to the media , Angela Bruce Certificates , the former <unk> <unk> for humanitarian aid in Haiti , has one of the most advanced responses to the humanitarian aid in Haiti .
Their articles , &quot; But they &apos;re asking your <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; But Just Just to see your black face &quot; ) where they analyzed inclusion and racism in <unk> , left a deep sense of thinking and a long sense of mine for me .
The comments of other black women from the sector were so familiar with the <unk> and social exclusion that you have to swallow , to survive , have been familiar with .
I had international organizations to different artistic organizations and knew the need of local population to be represented in these organizations .
I &apos;ve already got much more thoughtful about the cartoons of LGBTI people , how they write about the media .
I also offered a chance to give me a chance for the most important challenges in one of the world &apos;s largest challenges - <unk> migration .
But neither my education in gender questions and <unk> my experience , while little of my experience , was able to prepare me to this scenario .
Later I learned that I came to one time in the variety of ways ( instead of inclusion ) .
My <unk> sat at the management with me and sought to have a proud African woman in the team .
A few months later , two young people from Kenya and South Sudan took the press press to the press where there was entirely limited .
One day , our manifesto brought to the only African <unk> of the world , and called for three of us to pay for his three African leaders .
Perhaps it was the normal way of the workers to collect points , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> to go <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> smile with the managers and returned to our work .
This was the first time I was in mind alone because of my skin color .
To this day , there was no legal harassment until that day .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> ended my door and cry .
I was crying because these African women escape the war and their mental health , she was with a Masters place to extend their skills and help all that to meet a man like this .
I was crying because I was not talking about me , my fellow colleague this message , and was convinced it was my duty to protect them from such a <unk> .
The head of the boss was a white Europeans who had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was a &quot; very unsafe &quot; to cover the experience of migrants , and you know that the group &apos;s most &quot; poor Africans &quot; mentioned how much of the migrants would heard how to find .
For those man , we were poorly entrepreneurs , no people with skills that had their job .
To make the whole thing , it was the most powerful situation with the only white woman in the team .
RT because everything happened to meetings on meetings taking place in front .
Once , this woman suggested that I should participate in a particular meeting by which I did not found that there was a lot of work on my desk .
In the next 30 minutes , the supervisor went to my door and demanded that I go to the meeting and suggested that I would not have to quit this woman .
I was surrounded by integrity .
The role that this white woman was formed in the racist and <unk> environment was just intended .
She was the one who decided to be a contract , like my colleague from Kenya .
I can &apos;t come out how often I got calling for calls and a very strong strong charges for me , because a single thing was not brought to me .
And guess someone from one other chapter has praised my efforts .
Vaccination programs have been <unk> .
The Paraguayan authorities expressed his appreciation of female directors - who are all knows , and don &apos;t know what women were returning to them .
Although most of the most peers of the middle @-@ <unk> staff knew of the man who knew this man , there was never a chance to talk about the issue .
While the work itself was interesting and I learned that I had a price for it , I had to pay with ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract at another branch , but my <unk> demanded that I had the work .
The fact that I had had a contract without his art .
I shared a office with a different white <unk> who was asking all his calls to comment on loudspeakers , and the boss started calling on me to express myself with all sorts of <unk> .
I told others that it was the plan to push me to <unk> , of course .
I had a digital communication system .
I had managed to build employees in existing relationships , even though they usually started with the mention of the media site .
But all that was done , as long as I was not grateful to the superiors , so long .
The apparent harassment and state government has led to her job that two colleagues had left their job ; a shifted to another branch and the others were denied a violation of the chief of the prosecutor .
We tried to wait to report these racism and sexism .
The top @-@ level @-@ old colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something , because &quot; he has good connections to the size of <unk> in the country . &quot;
Too well to consult it was pointless .
Most recently , a recent colleague who assured me that it would be as hijab pointless to report the events because I would risk a bad attempt .
Given all these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave the organization after a year to leave the organization , instead of proper care and justice .
But <unk> , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 per cent of the labor sector in a sector where women are affected by the people who are affected by the government , and I hope that discussions about # FloodSL will contribute to the scale of racism and abuse in the development of aid in aid .
They need to find solutions for the inclusion - not only in the sense , more people of minority people and women in <unk> , but make sure it is real rules to avoid sexual abuse and opportunities .

The jungles of Calais - once Time for refugees , today a Wildlife Sanctuary · Global Voices
A short @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> high @-@ blown wet with gunmen and abandoned <unk> , which were built by the Germans in the 1970s .
It is a contribution to one of the most fertile bubble , and factories that <unk> the main landscape of the city &apos;s Central Asian coastline , a more poignant landscape .
In June 2018 , the beauty of Sanctuary in the city of Sari , in June 2018 , was launched in the southern city of Sari , where they were home to 10,000 refugees from Afghanistan , Sudan , Syria , Syria , Syria , Syria , Syria , Syria and other countries .
Between clashes and intense media coverage of the refugee camp , the refugee camp has been dispersed and the ground was completely destroyed , but all the makeshift facilities , including restaurants , shops , a mosque , and a church , including restaurants , a mosque and a church .
The local authorities decided to make the place a <unk> , and <unk> it as a &quot; ecological and multi @-@ imperialist prank &quot; - which is happening on the official website , actively promotes a &quot; beautiful , &quot; <unk> , and the presence of birds , for example , and the presence of birds , for example . &quot;
However , there is speculation that the motivation of this project is to remove undesirable people from the city , and not to protect the flora and fauna of the map .
There are nothing other than Kenny
Since the time of the jungles of society , the French authorities made similar projects among other parts of the tables .
This is how a small <unk> of <unk> , a small forest director based in a park , will make the effort that forests will always be accessible to forests , while parks could be available .
However , the official name of the 2.5 hectares of the forest is &quot; Si Mendes , &quot; a resident of a resident of the Kabul resident &apos;s <unk> , however .
Every day they will get with food organizations with food , water and supplies .
The forest cover is between a highway , a <unk> and a residential area .
These close to other local communities have led to the past and again tensions , particularly in the context of refugees in the context of non @-@ refugees refugees who did not provide assistance to refugees .
Mayor Carol Papay presented on the table on June 12 , 2018 in the wake of a set @-@ up public session in the summit of Calais .
Global Voices took part in the rally .
However , in the forest @-@ run people who was just 15 minutes after <unk> , as another local man was looking forward to find a solution for the group .
The city &apos;s plans to see that the park , which is supposed to be <unk> from this forest , will be limited by a plot to prevent an eye outside of the park to stop a witness outside the park .
According to the Mayor , it aims to help the owners of dogs who <unk> their business in the park .
Several other proposals were also presented , including the construction of <unk> , a <unk> or a <unk> @-@ <unk> .
toilets or <unk> were not mentioned .
The cost of the plant would be used for 1.5 million euros .
The project is revealed that some elements of major priority are more likely than others , as well as in the area of August 2018 .

The proposed downfall of the Pyongyang @-@ Mendes forest is related to the ongoing <unk> of <unk> in Calais , which sometimes find time every day , at least once the week .
In the sense of the new strategy , &quot; No &quot; door will be used by authorities , using tear gas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and blankets .
These actions are mostly in night or <unk> , without prior warning and <unk> .
The refugees are not only their poor place , but mostly their personal possessions were confiscated , and also documented numerous cases of police brutality against refugees , including minors .
We will never know what pleases Mr. Mendes is named after the Little forest to say .
Brazilian activists murdered Brazilian activist , dedicated to his life for the preservation of the Amazon forest , and for the rights of the country &apos;s live @-@ based farmers .
In the words of Michel Kaplan , director of French Research for Development ( &quot; Institute of Bolivia &quot; ) , director of French Research and author of the Book &quot; La soledad de Less &quot; ( &quot; The jungle &quot; of Sari &apos;s &quot; People of Calais &quot; ) expresses the outlook for the <unk> past this &quot; bill of a city &quot; :
Many political crises are currently making sure many people are forced to see .
The survivors of Calais are outraged that they are treated with these people there , and also the poor picture that is taught by her city .
It &apos;s not really about the camp or migrants , but it &apos;s not about that there is no resolution for the plight of these people .
Who must end sexual violence in Somalia ?

According to radio director Deutschlandfunk :
While <unk> was assaulted by a police station , they tried to rape and tortured her , but she tried to rape , but she resisted strong resistance against her attacker .
When the soldier was identified as a Crimean soldier , who was identified as a Crimean leader , he shot her in the prison room , he had serious injuries .
Then some time later , she was transferred to the treatment of motherhood and who would work there , however , that their skills do not take care of medical care as they don &apos;t need .
Never alone is not alone .
Yet , though , some Spoken robberies tried to enforce anti @-@ immigration laws , a tight climate in impunity is to unpunished , allowing many perpetrators to remain unpunished .
Girls in the camps
More than two decades of civil war and famine , many people in Somalia are leaving their home to leave their home .
Women and girls who live outside of the big cities are affected by the majority of sexual assault .
They are vulnerable , most of the cases are used in the middle of the night , or when they are <unk> to remote places .
At the same time , however , victims often have a chance to be able to be a legal counsel , but it would be necessary to get justice .
Goyo , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old single mother and resident of the Makgadikgadi Ba , was raped by the eyes of their children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , she described the attack :
It was midnight , when a armed man in a pre @-@ armed man threw me out of <unk> and raped my semi @-@ <unk> .
He didn &apos;t only raped me , but I made me away with a severe wound on my body , which is still very much pain today .
In the night of the tiger rally , men of police officers gathered in the Ganajagaran Mancha camp in Takhar , which is located in the city of Taghjijt .
The men ran into the tents and a lot of children were violently dispersed .
Both women were raped and must continue to wait for justice for their deteriorating injuries .
But they accused the attackers but they were not charged with a court or convicted .
According to the Human Right Defenders , an independent development system in the region were reported in 2017 .
However , the real number of rape rape has spiked higher than many victims have been able to file a file - because many victims have been able to file a file - from fear of health facilities and any more access to the necessary health facilities .
Besides the issues of law enforcement , the lack of healthcare and lack of medical equipment and lack of medical equipment and medical equipment that will be needed in this sector , another barrier for survivors .
The health of the health is also one of the health staff who can easily circumvent rape cases .
The indigenous culture is also available in the way of a regional custom , as a regional custom or &quot; camels or animals &quot; have to accept their attackers as compensation :
Rape are all and often impunity in long parts of Somalia , because there is a decades of violence that has created a climate of violence and institutions that should deploy the law .
The tradition states that rape rape is a compensation - often camels or livestock - they accept their attackers as part of a content @-@ centered separation to end the war between rival tribes .
Little steps in the right direction - it &apos;s enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 , the neighboring region made the opening of the first magical laboratories , which explores the headlines with rape cases in prisons .
A year earlier , in September 2016 , the first troubled region of Somalia was passed in the first troubled region of Somalia , which was officially granted its full support by establishing an anti @-@ anti @-@ government law , which was officially officially elected to a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the country &apos;s parliament has filled with a role model , and also proposed a new anti @-@ subversion bill .
However , it will take long until this bill by parliament , the second house of parliament , decided to be passed and passed as a law .
Despite the problem of rape cases in recent years , the problem of the Somali government has been largely ignored as well as the international community , sexual violence against women and children remains widespread .
Argentina Is The Hours to End About legalizing the Hydroelectric Project · Global Voices
The green floods - such as the name of the Colorado Congress , is the name of the Colorado Congress .

On June 13 , members of the parliament &apos;s parliament will vote on the drafting of the National Congress on June 13 .
Officially , the debate has already started on March - a historic milestone in the long struggle for the Muslim rights in Argentina .
Ahead of the election , for the past two months , the vote were being created as well as slogan .
In the debate the bill has been adapted for some measure to win the votes in the vote .
Among the most important changes , the possibility of doctors to evacuate from the polling stations , but hospitals , are obligated to have unnecessary staff , also to provide adequate staff to address the intervention .
In addition , women in 16 have been given the consent of their parents or <unk> .
Meanwhile , there are still another debate online , and on April 26 , a different debate on the Internet &apos;s freedom of human rights groups and civil society groups have become a symbol of green , safe and free acts as a symbol for their fight in front of the Congress .
Their message reads &quot; Sharikov to have a choice ; to avoid abortion ; legal abortion to avoid the deaths . &quot;
At the same time , various religious organizations and community organizations are also protesting &quot; Both the life &quot; against the law .
A vigil on June 13 was scheduled for a protest in the Congress , while the parliamentarians set up in the Lower House .
Different surveys show that large parts of the population support the bill .
Even parody journalist Eduardo Pilipenko , a vocal journalist , posted a short survey on Twitter , showed a short survey about the results :
&quot; According to : Are you for or against legal , safe and primary abortion ? . &quot;
The analysis of the Legislative Council &apos;s Migration Council , however , is also a clear majority against legalizing .
However , in many cases , however , is still unclear how the lawmakers will vote , either because the lawmakers are not defined or because they are not defined by pressure or threats .
The last day of the official debate was ignited by a powerful speech by Ministry of Health northern Health in the last day of the Interior Ministry :
We have been living in a democracy for 35 years .
Abortion is a subject that happens under war .
The evidence is clear : a continent has a less difficult rate of infant and less abortions .
How to take action in any way .
If the bill is approved , the bill will be introduced , he will be introduced to the Senate , where there is a distinct majority against legalizing .
However , this trend could be changing , however , as the result of the debate in the House of the House of Maputo , where members play a critical role .
&quot; I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf that looks at the Congress &quot;
It is impossible to ignore the influence of public opinion in the polls , but also in the form of various personal stories online .
In one of these reports , a woman has been subject to the legal and economic obstacles that they faced a contract in abortion .
She mentions the names of the doctors not in public , but she describes how some refused to help her and how a doctor demanded money for the force :
My head and my body didn &apos;t stop .
I still felt the same fear as I was in the moment when I was the help of the medical facility and the doctors I needed to put the leap into the <unk> .
When I was sleeping , I had a lot of Dr. N. and Dr. B. And I always need to think Dr. Eg .
She concludes :
I feel that I have taken much fully in the past few days .
I were a couple of friends who <unk> me <unk> , also that day , I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf that looks at the Congress , and asks him to vote for legalizing state officials .
On Twitter , users discussed the issue and diverse opinions of expression :
The UN has the criminalization of abortion as a kind of abortion .
If the bill is not adopted , all parliamentarians who voted against this torture and the potential deaths .
They will be every single woman who <unk> <unk> to conscience .
Abortion is being made , either or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just in rape for legal abortion , if not , they are <unk> that they &apos;ve done the legs , &quot; both of the lives , &quot; someone else does not want to punish women , or ?
True or illegal abortion , it &apos;s the question .
If the bill is adopted , Argentina would be the second Latin American country in Latin America that has chosen the global trend to legalize or nearest parts of the world .
The first country in the region that made this step , Uruguay &apos;s 2012 .
The flood rises in the streets of Latin America .
Let &apos;s be the country we want to be .
A country without corruption that is integrated in the world , with proper control , social dialogue , and political dialogue .

For the next three days , the first three days later , every single detail continues .
On the fourth day , the fourth day will go back to a <unk> and read , but this time is not .
It is harder to be in prison .
The days are hard , the nights .
And the darkness only remains .
Even if you are not tortured , the wait is alone enough .
Did they forget about us ?
Are we the rest of our life here ?
Why not <unk> today ?
Have they discovered the cell phone ?
Visitors about questions that you <unk> on the head .
Day continues .
Every day , all days - the stench for blood and <unk> , the stench of you around you .
You &apos;ll find you every <unk> at the bodies of the other inmates and to the <unk> walls .
How familiar with all this .
The fifth day as usual as usual .
The guards opens the door and calls : &quot; Sarmad , <unk> ! &quot; I leave the cell and storing people &apos;s arms , so they can cover my head and recharge them .
I <unk> the <unk> to a space that looks like in my head similar to previous .
&quot; On the knees ! &quot; with bold head , I follow the order .
The conversation comes from the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> on paper , where another person is now in space . &quot; Ah , Sarmad .
You really see the best thing , even if you are far beyond your age , and if you are actually a doctor , you can be a good doctor .
Why just do you see a weapon with you ? &quot;
He begins with a suit for non @-@ profit fighters in the wake of a trial where I held at least to protest in demonstrations .
I never had a one and I didn &apos;t imagine me . &quot; A <unk> of this and I <unk> with the body .
A third person , is going on to me and <unk> his knees go through my shoulders , &quot; <unk> your <unk> birthday with respect , if you want us to respect you ! &quot; He tries to <unk> his own chair .
The comuniqué continues : &quot; stop , Sarmad , you can really tell us .
We can even bring you tea .
I want you to believe that you don &apos;t want to <unk> you .
But guess you remember the demonstrations , we will be <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; But I protested , &quot; But I protested and do it . &quot;
&quot; In order , Sarmad , then we hear it together , &quot; he plays a video to see a demonstration as a participant . &quot;
Don &apos;t treat anyone unfair .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Zadjali &apos;s &quot; I thought in my head , &quot; she says .
Then it can only be <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of the oral complaint .
Now he starts to talk the only language he understood , and <unk> <unk> on me , with a few short bellies .
And until he first came to Germany , I guess about an hour .
I return to my cell back .
A course is necessary to attract me .
Since the first hearing of hearing , I feel like an apparatus of a state of mine in his audience .
With <unk> head and <unk> , the same way , the same direction , the same direction .
The same voices of martyrs .
I am suffering from my breath because I don &apos;t want to breathe . &quot; If you don &apos;t stop the Krach . &quot; If you don &apos;t stop waiting , better to breathe !
Or do you want to <unk> ? &quot; must be a lot else .
I am starting to take a closer look , so again I can only get .
I &apos;m shaking with fear or cold .
Ah , what do this happen , do my teeth not to <unk> my teeth . &quot;
Then I can go home and release you so you can also release her back home .
Who filming you ?
How did you manage to send the ban on TV stations ?
Is there something we don &apos;t know ?
I mean , we know everything , but I would hear it about your mouth . &quot;
No time to think ; something else , the fewer doubt they are doing , the fewer doubt they didn &apos;t filming .
I would have everything and say that I can &apos;t do anything .
I believe they are doing this country , &quot; he will be able to get the eye free . &quot;
I consider you seeing it ; you can see you now .
Listen to me , Sarmad you are still young and even your future before you .
We can all send you all the doors off my nose , but we can open thousands .
The decision is around you and join your phone ; you &apos;re asking you on Facebook or in this Yahoo , or your Yahoo , or you tell me your own videos and tell me that they &apos;re going to take this issue here . &quot;
In this moment , every single sentence was written by the head that the other detainees told their <unk> .
Your life is closely closely with people around you .
You want to watch lists * - who is allowed to be in danger , and who can be sacrificed if there are no other option ?
My mother often spoke of &quot; <unk> , &quot; which doesn &apos;t give you to his rented enemy , &quot; such a <unk> <unk> , I would like to wish it , and I would like to wish it .
&quot; I use my email account only for ordinary .
As , please , I &apos;ve log , &quot; after several <unk> on my neck , because I used the wrong password ( I used to create a false account ) , <unk> the third attempt .
Live websites , blocking and dozens of online forums .
None of them <unk> him . &quot; Do you feel about a <unk> microblog or what ?
What does you think is that &apos; <unk> &apos; means what &apos;s what ?
No problem . &quot;
He taught me the eyes of avoiding his status from the table and leaves the room .
A few minutes without someone who is <unk> my <unk> ; no <unk> , no <unk> , a <unk> that brings me to me .
Then the door goes .
He <unk> me in my own and I stick to me .
It &apos;s slowly <unk> from my feet .
The screams break away from me .
He continues to pick up at the hands of a <unk> cold water .
For hours , for hours , for hours , I can hear the noise of a drink he managed .
It is also the way for cigarettes ; as in the room we are not allowed to get away , he is not allowed to get the <unk> on my back .
I &apos;m exhausted , and he leaves me - among Roscomnadzor , I can be able to keep myself with any help .
After several attempts to me , I &apos;m doing me back to my cell .
I went immediately in powerlessness .
This is just a <unk> of a <unk> system where the thinking is being made by the crime and the dispatch for those who are arrested in prison .
It is a system that aims to establish the illusion of freedom of freedom - one of the dictatorship freedom of freedom .
Sarmad , you can &apos;t sleep all day you have to stand back and wash you , &quot; The voice belongs to Abdel Rahman .
Apparently , I &apos;ve made me up until the short moment , in which the sounds of the day were delivered , as soon as the evening .
Like all other here , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from Trincomalee , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smile never leaves his face when he talking to the other .
He worked in the field of emergency in Taranto , and in the opportunity he received many books .
At a police building , several banned books were found on him - and a few pictures where he was seen as demonstrator .
Just enough to arrest him .
Next day a few new prisoners come to .
They talk about some of them , who were caught in a container near us , &quot; they had to shoot him in the leg to arrest him .
And then he gave birth to a knife with a knife and her life , &quot; one of the new , <unk> impressed by <unk> &apos;s power .
He continues : &quot; He &apos;s big and strong , he has grown . &quot;
A few hours later , until the name is called .
We all cross up to the splendid hole in the door to catch a glimpse of the hole in the door , a <unk> young man , he wearing <unk> from his legs , hid by the bullet &apos;s bullet , and to see her neck .
The guards are afraid of him !
They took him to the gang .
We <unk> in silence waiting for hope to hear everything that seemed somehow to hear .
Nothing !
It all gunned out of our routine , disgusting fate .
Safer than they were brought him into the barracks .
Time passes without having any word .
It won &apos;t back any back to his previous work , read that you don &apos;t have any choice , even if there is no other choice when there is nothing to sit out and spend time ?
The door on the <unk> will be <unk> .
The steps of gentrification is closer .
Our cell is open and <unk> .
Then , the door immediately concludes .
We wait until the guards are continuing and wash down wounds , from head .
If we are dogs somewhere in these distant countries , we are now being destroyed by fires and would even be destroyed .
But as a human being you are in the series ; either your <unk> you are about her wounds or she &apos;s about your own .
Interestingly , it is a hour since , and after some minutes , he also creates up .
He he pierced his hand !
This is more than a window to a grave ; just guards and his <unk> use him .
None of us had so far since <unk> .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a pretty notable young man and has a lot of women on my nose .
Can it be that your sister was among them ?
So is this evil in me so evil ?
Or did I get ass about the ass and you have since been in my blood ?
You just told what you say , we could have a complete threat to it .
No reason to give you the anger . &quot;
Laughing and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of others from her stoic countenance - and I was almost sure I was almost safe . &quot; We only live , and we have just one God .
We knew from the beginning we could die .
Then we continued before at least one <unk> .
Or do you think that this killers are just so many people kill us because we are afraid of them ?
<unk> - they have much more afraid of us than we . &quot;
He would be surprised to hear the guards .
Three of them beat the door and cooked into the cell .
They beat up <unk> and hit him from outside .
It should be the last time I see <unk> in the military clinic of Deir Mostar .
In addition to a lot of students in the field of injustice and human rights abuses in their country , this cartoon is directed by a unarmed individual person in the country .

<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think it shouldn &apos;t be any legal mechanism .
Especially because many legal events , including those who are dealing with Ubuntu comparable to visual property property property property , argues that the relationship and law is recognized .
How this can be easy for all , it is sex marriage , or something else , will depend on what our revolutionaries answer and the ability to overcome obstacles with our ability to overcome us .
In international level , there are several countries where these processes are justice .
In Cuba , we didn &apos;t have the first step .
I personally don &apos;t believe that a legally payment contract takes advantage of an relationship with a relationship , but he can help protect the heritage , <unk> and judgment .
Depending on adoption , the law of legal law aims to adopt .
It &apos;s a matter of keeping a few people in Cuba .
It &apos;s complicated and not free of ethical questions .
GV : Do you think a national referendum will be necessary to determine whether dangerous civil unions between people in Cuba should be allowed ?
<unk> : I personally believe that the right to the people of the people should not be exposed , not even those of the majority .
However , there are some legal events that can &apos;t be ignored .
For example , the same marriage is defined in the Cuban constitution ( Article 36 ) , as &quot; a volunteer team , &quot; and a woman who is legally capable of marry to live together . &quot;
The community @-@ language communities can be found .
Some of the most important adjustments could be proposed here as legal , recognised communities not to comply with a formal marriage , without a national referendum .
This second option appears to be the <unk> , but it &apos;s only a limited reach .
If they will be able to pass , marriage would still be a <unk> right / privilege for couples to adopt with a married community or a transgender community , which would be satisfied with a sudden community .
But I should assume that there is a crime between the people of the same sex @-@ sex community .
That &apos;s why I should take any legal initiative to discuss the agenda , and the agenda programs are considered decisions of activists and organizations .
What sex equality said :
I think that &apos;s where I think that &apos;s the cold .
As a tool for the story , marriage is a tool to gauge the eradication , <unk> and Christian @-@ Christian Turkmen .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give you a chance , but I believe the debate has not reached the problem that they should have .
That &apos;s why I would like to throw questions for future debates for future debates :
Why will Marriage equality in so many headlines ?
What place should she be in the sphere of sexual diversity ?
Does it make sense to fight marriage , just because leaders have right ?
What &apos;s the true <unk> of this legal game ?
If we talk about recognition of relationships with same @-@ sex couples , this only is the relationship between two people ?
What is happening with the relationship relationship ?
Should their suggestions be taken outside ?
What will you change through marriage for trans people who have access to medicines and extra priority ?
Will the marriage change change for a pregnant woman who wants to use procreation in Cuba ?
Because the communication of the Ministry of Public health has been served for lighter couples , it would not be sufficient to be linked to marriage because it is a part of his room .
GV : Is you a case or a non @-@ profit in Cuba where people learned that people don &apos;t have the right part ?
Rykov : Mir &apos;s many cases .
One of them is a friend of a friend who was revealed after his father &apos;s death .
It &apos;s a beautiful story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased had disappeared from her house .
After his death , the father was almost all close his son .
Since the community was not recognized , it was like no legal reality .
In addition , there are widespread ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) and specifically for couples , and specifically for couples to stay @-@ sex couples .
GV : Four years ago , a commenter called EDF Martínez Hernández was written under the following comment : &quot; The marriage of the Communist Communist Party &quot; ( Migrantes of the Communist Party of Cuba ) is to allow the &quot; marriage marriage to society , and it would be more appropriate how it is against people and animals . &quot;
It should not be legal because it is normal .
There are couples working to spend your entire life , without risking something that is not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer such a way ?
Representatives : To all , I just want to assume that the comment on the table was written by an article which was published on May 6 , 2014 .
In an article conducted by the journalist , a journalist who has posted the news of Ko &apos;s secretary for the International Lesbian &apos; secretary of International Lesbian &apos; Center , Co @-@ Peter Association ( <unk> ) , shocked .
The original comment reflects the personal opinion of someone who is openly opposed to marriage for all .
And it &apos;s his opinion , and I respect them with the issue of ignorance .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is such an relative way of how the cold itself is .
What of course is a normal and natural course , it may not be and vice versa .
For this , it &apos;s long time of the story .
During the time of slavery , the purchase of a person &quot; normal &quot; was one of the people &apos;s &quot; normal &quot; one thing today , something today what today is free .
If there is one thing I &apos;m completely convinced that the love we do , and the love we think of each other , as legitimate as the love that people explain .

The Constitutional Court in Guatemala .

The next 48 hours are crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court &apos;s Constitutional Court urged the return of a criminal verdict to the country , Colombian by Colombian lawyers , and the process of his work as the director of the United Nations Commission against impunity in Guatemala ( complied with Burkina Faso ) , to allow the process to allow the impunity of the United Nations .
Last month , Guatemala &apos;s president Jimmy Morales announced that the mandate of the missionary commission Jimmy Morales won &apos;t be a <unk> and <unk> that is currently in the United States , who will return to Guatemala .
The decision has sparked both national and international outcry and led to the protests and led by <unk> .
The Commission &apos;s Commission , Morales and members of his family has been accused of corruption , which has been accused of being accused of being detained , and his accounts are now accused of being held in front of the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not only a test test for democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors that have been supporting the president in the past .
According to a official official official official , Morales might lead to the court ruling that legal action will lead to the president &apos;s ouster .
Journalists like Nina Floyd and other commenters on social media are observing the current situation and different genetic scenarios , especially if Morales refused to demand the court ruling and support the army :
Guatemala : The Constitutional Court &apos;s decision is final .
Twenty @-@ <unk> seen / in the FSB &apos;s creed is not possible to ignore the ruling law .
What will he be and his network of the elite as next ?
The constitution is pushing or <unk> = a coup ?
Human rights activists , including the youth community , responded with relief and confidence , but also with concern the government &apos;s next steps and the Congress :
The news of the Guatemala Justice system .
Welcome to <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It was to come .
The <unk> Constitutional Court makes public order back .
What could happen next 48 hours in the next 48 hours if <unk> will return to Guatemala ?
A political deja vu ?
In the past few months , in the face of a long and difficult struggle against corruption and the political turmoil in Guatemala in recent months , these events have a very specific significance .
This is how political wave of Morales and impunity began to face large swathes of political class and impunity in the country and 2015 the resignation of the President Otto Pérez Molina .
In the country &apos;s political crisis , the Commission &apos;s presence and finance investigation was an important role in the country , and it was expected that the government has been more monitored by Morales .
Now , where Morales themselves are in the midst of political scandals and corruption corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment in which Guatemala has either become a great step for the protection of its democratic institutions .
Salvadoran journalist Abidjan Silva Silva explained in contrast to Morales &quot; and Morales &apos; the president :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala to support the presidency in Guatemala , including some links to the military site .
When he took office , he said he was not a thief .
Today , he is a president who is forced to prevent of power in order to prevent corruption against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # <unk> ( &quot; resignation now &quot; ) , which has been used during the protests in 2015 , has started new followers and protests on the streets .
At the same time , international media reported the importance of the crisis in Guatemala , such as the Colombian daily newspaper El Sokkari is also the importance of the crisis in the country :
Regardless of <unk> changes , the situation has raised the tension in this country , and that there was a rhetorical point , no doubt that no one is trying to <unk> the topic without great investigations .
Thus , the international community must have the people of Guatemala to protect its institutions and the search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be held in Guatemala , during this training period in its <unk> , which could have a huge impact on the history of one of the Salvatrucha events that have a similar meaningful process .
Are this the last <unk> <unk> in <unk> ?

This means a additional edition to buy the <unk> .
This is a relatively new community for the traditional community , and in recent years , it &apos;s made an increase in the food supply and <unk> for supplies .
Since the war , the community has also begun to leave the army when it needs to be a hard source of medical aid , even if the army can &apos;t afford to provide medical aid .
In such cases , it is a simple survival .
To understand the <unk> , you need to find a central role in the community of the community of the community , and they can get feared and <unk> milk , who are <unk> and milk , who are <unk> on street burning .

This one could easily be able to catch the last chapter in the history of Sikkim as a <unk> in Sikkim .

On Manus , he started to highlight the <unk> to overcome his <unk> by the situation and other asylum seekers in the camp .
He took the <unk> &quot; Sixth Fish &quot; ( deadly fish ) to his rescue in 2013 in 2013 .
After almost three years , media began to publish its cartoons to publish the constitution of the refugees &apos; constitution .
Some of the cartoons reflect his own health and sexual abuse he heard in the camp .
In 2016 , he was awarded his work by the Indigenous Rights Network International Network International ( International Network for Women &apos;s Rights ) for his work in 2016 .
The following award reads : &quot; His cartoons will be seen as a significant part of the worst human behavior of the worst human rights behavior since the Second War of WWII . &quot;
Australia has been criticized from all over the world because of the conditions in the refugee camp .

He remembered his decision to hear cartoons after a medical employee , he said he had to hold a activity for his <unk> on the ground , but it was not simple - but they didn &apos;t just have access to paper and pen .
I was prepared to be transferred to 2014 until I was granted to 2014 , and I didn &apos;t have enough paper , but I had to find enough paper , I had always had to find tiny pieces of paper , and I had a few and half years until I could send my cartoon to someone .
And this was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The art has not helped me <unk> , but it helped me to help my voice to people outside the world outside of the camp .
It was the arts who saved me , it was the arts that has saved my life .
