In different places , especially in West Africa , migration is a &quot; <unk> , &quot; as Madiba calls it .
From many , migration will be considered a normal strategy to find work , but it doesn &apos;t matter &quot; if it is migration in the country or the neighbouring countries - the most common form of migration , especially in West Africa - or if you are traveling in a bigger distance , &quot; says Mejia .
Europe is not always the aim of migration .
Sicilian writes :
These travel journalists often have a certain place .
You can get a time for half a time to work , and to earn money .
And then you are going to continue and remains on another place for some time .
Or you will be deported to the country .
The whole thing is more than a powerful way to Europe when he is so often misrepresented .
Without work and economic opportunities , it will be considered the <unk> decision to leave home and seek opportunities for better prospects .
Just as a young human being , the decision of dignity is also one of the dignity of dignity , for the sake of a <unk> , responsible person , and for their family .
A lot of young people are often expected to have their parents and other family members , &quot; says Mejia .
Judge agrees : &quot; It is about to improve the situation .
Among the youth in Mali , there are narratives about reporting about his country .
There is an basic sense that the political system of youth will help . &quot;
For the young people , which can be expected and they can play their <unk> as adults , they are looking for their country .
As long as the situation is not change in their homeland , the young people will take to other places .
&quot; It will be OK , &quot; who ?
In the words , &quot; It &apos;s ok &quot; the young Guineans &apos; young Guineans in their country .
But who can the impact of the <unk> , guarantee that the current situation will be OK ?
Like many other campaigns of the EU , the video is only less <unk> on the <unk> of migration , mentioning the young people in their homeland , not explicitly explicitly .
Caption is the notion : &quot; If they want to stay at home , they would have some of the possibilities that exists there . &quot;

In the moment , he is living in a dormitory field in the town of bus , and waiting for the foreseeable decision to complete his nationality in complete years .
But the doctor Pass is much more than a document .
&quot; You see my face in my face that I &apos;m different , &quot; he says in the halls in dormitory .
&quot; I say indifference , but not like a Georgians .
I speak out , I don &apos;t see how a Armenians .

While the country &apos;s <unk> fly , since the country is the third year in the country &apos;s third country , the country &apos;s political tactics are on the wake of political beliefs .
Usually , campaign campaigns to represent the promise and vision of a particular candidate or candidate or a certain party .
But this is the time that Turkish democracy will be put on politics and it is all other than common .
The country has been a state of emergency in the state of emergency in July 2016 since nearly 24 months ago , the state of the state , as well as the state of the state , as well as by Erdogan &apos;s arch @-@ nemesis .
President ideology , the candidate of the ruling party for Justice and Development ( AKP ) , has been in power since 2002 , after spending more than a decade before he was elected to President 2014 .
The two years after the failed arrests in July 2016 , a harsh crackdown on the political opposition , the free press , and even on social media posts .
The public service was also described as the military , the judiciary , and the science and science science .
Wikipedia , the largest online encyclopedia of the world , is currently blocked within the country .
In this context , it is no wonder that Erdogan &apos;s clumsy @-@ <unk> is difficult to gain a electorate by nearly 60 million voters , including 1.5 million new voters who are just 18 years old .
Thus , Soludo denies that the generous media report that has received its campaign from the national channel and other pro @-@ pro @-@ pro @-@ pro @-@ government mainstream media under the current state of emergency .
&quot; Share me a example .
Where and the campaign has been blocked ? &quot;
He also suggested that the state of emergency could be lifted after the elections .
In general , it is general that the most important president of the president will be approved .
His opponents quickly leave him .
This exchange doesn &apos;t only provide <unk> relief for a tense political atmosphere , but also offers important insights to what this election is , its three important opponents and Turkish voters is really important .

In an prominent example , Erdogan has been declared the growth of the annual growth of the annual progress of the annual progress in Turkey since the country &apos;s takeover of AKP .
Francey checks in a time and suggested that the Turkish word for refrigerator , acknowledging , in Turkish Twitter , became a trend :
Erdogan &apos;s sworn in a rally in Upper Beach , a city of roughly survived kilometers from Istanbul : &quot; How many shells were sold ( then in 2002 ? ) !
How much is the sale for sale ? !
It means that people are poor .
If there is a soul in every household - <unk> - then - then the wealth has to be everywhere .
Impossible to Erdogan &apos;s refrigerator , the refrigerator has been for 40 years .
You are who <unk> him !
The answer is important , as much as the majority of Erdogan &apos;s hope is based on a victory in the first round of how voters expressed its leadership in the country &apos;s economy .
In the past , ( AKP ) , the AKP , among the socio @-@ conservative <unk> , has also been focused on the core support of the party .
But in the past 16 years , the country &apos;s pro @-@ capita GDP has been in the last 16 years since the AKP is in power , is the economy of many fronts .
Furthermore , the staggering <unk> of Turkish literature has led to a reduction in the U.S. dollars in the early year , while the party is regularly criticized for public funds to ensure that they have been making public funds in expensive business .

The perhaps <unk> candidate in Turkey is secular justice , the Ko Leader and presidential candidate of the Kurdish leftist People &apos;s member of the Kurdish leftist People ( PTC ) .

A campaign in Japan provides more special metal metal metal metal metal editors which can <unk> them on par with similar harassment and similar harassment .
The sinister Prevention of Center ( about t @-@ combatants ) organizes this campaign already in its third year .
The Japanese word &quot; <unk> &quot; will be both for the actual side of the country and the <unk> itself .
The channels included several messages that highlight the readers that a crime is a crime and that it won &apos;t be done .
With the wearing &quot; <unk> Bags @-@ maid &quot; to show the girl how much they hate .
In order to understand that they will have to understand with sexual harassment and attacks .
Women who drive to train with the train , unfortunately , unfortunately , have often been very often .
According to the Japan Times :
The figures of figures show that in 2017 , widespread cases of abuse or harassment were reported in the morning of 30 per cent between 7 and 9 .
Over 50 percent of the cases are <unk> on the trains , and more 20 percent on Delhi .
In the same vein , reported that nearly 30 percent of the disappeared teens are .
patents speculate that the police clause should be presented as &quot; telecommunications <unk> &quot; ( <unk> ) .
It is also often reported that it is difficult to follow such cases .
While the police , and the anti @-@ polio campaign are regular campaigns that should stop the march in the trains , these messages are usually helping themselves to be able to change women , and will not try to change the behavior of the men .
The comments are often trying to understand what such behavior and media is still focusing on how men can protect themselves on fake accusations of <unk> .
I don &apos;t care about it !
Sexual harassment is a crime !
Activist Kanako , a activist , which represents the sinister <unk> Center Center ( around t feet ) , says the idea of the event was a student and her mother , a friend of mine , was mentioned .
In her first year , the girl was being harassed on a daily basis on the ground and at school school .
&quot; The perpetrators don &apos;t recognize any sign of <unk> &quot; I don &apos;t want to get back , &quot; the girl decided .
And so , as a map of which they used a map :
&quot; I don &apos;t care about it !
Sexual harassment are a crime ! ! &quot;
Then took the girls to their homes and took the school to school .
She never became back again .
Sasemadehy has reported that the girl &apos;s campaign had some success in the social media , and it came to the idea with the idea of the idea .
The Japan Times reported :
Recently , in November with a crowdfunding project , a crowdfunding project ( <unk> ) was collected in just three months ( 325 euro ) .
To make sure that the young women would like design , she received <unk> software ideas by encouraging people to the last five .
In January , the Zeferino Ladrillero Center in January has also been launched in front of the Canary War Center ( Avoid sexual harassment ) to prevent awareness of the problem .
The idea for this non @-@ campaign campaign is that the girls can highlight the harassment and thereby show that the society is not <unk> :
The concept of this <unk> :
:
- None of them <unk>
- No one to a <unk>
- No one is being charged with <unk>
In 2015 , the deadline to sale on the internet was sent to sale on the internet .
There are also available , as well as the emergence of this campaign , as well as awareness of the campaign &apos;s campaign will also be offered in a fashion sphere and in stores in stores .
There is no difference if we &apos;re able to wear in short or a bit of skirts or jeans - always <unk> .
We want this idea , &quot; You have to do something to get a more inclusive &quot; the monuments !
Note text : I don &apos;t care anymore !
Electoral is a crime !
&quot; I want other children to do the same experience I had to go through &quot;
Officially , sexual assault , including <unk> .
However , the center is not reported that many incident are not reported in reports , and that the statistics are not true .
Thus , it is important for <unk> and other activists important to give young women to hand their sexual assault on the train .
This <unk> seems to help .
School students at High School School High School School High School , who participated in the campaign with strategies to help protect the effectiveness of animals in 2016 in 2016 .
At least 1.4 % say that they would not help , <unk> % have been blocked not more changes and <unk> % , &quot; I had the feeling that you would help and have a difference .
The anti @-@ campaign campaign seems to have a lot of reactions .
In 2016 , about a year after the project was launched , published on a Twitter account that was linked to the trumped @-@ up Prevention Center Center , which was written by a adult lady :

&quot; Prankery , <unk> ... &quot; - an declarations by clever Pauline , which highlights its interpretation of the Macedonian nationalist nationalist , in 2011 by citizens for a anti @-@ European Macedonia .

While most of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have seen a serious issue with Greece as a serious issue , some through humor and satire .
Greece has been accused of having long @-@ faced names that have long been given a name , which is easy to assess the country &apos;s neighboring Greek region and the ancient Greek kingdom .
It is also difficult to anticipate that Greece is making the involvement of the European Union ( EU ) and NATO ( NATO ) , as long as the name is not changed , as long as the name is not changed to the Greek northern country .
This has led to a certain degree of xenophobia in both countries .
Most of the people &apos;s inhabitants see the blockade as a <unk> form of blackmail , while many Greeks believe their northern neighbors is a wish for them .
The nationalists of both countries have been the feelings of humiliation and frustration , which increases the problem , and also <unk> political support for &quot; patriotism . &quot;
Indeed , Russia &apos;s policy is a policy of Russia &apos;s policy to prevent the country &apos;s country or NATO in the countries .
The only point in the <unk> , the consensus between Macedonia and Greece , is that it is not a laugh .
During the past few years , the percentage of more satirical or more content about the topic was related to <unk> comments and hate speech .
Targeted or not , satire was often <unk> as hate speech .

Since April 18 , 2018 , the chaos and the rights of protesters are directly threatened by the police and the media .
As protesters , more social security and government accountability demanding the government , were attacked by police , the military and other military forces were attacked by the police and their physical forces .
According to some estimates , the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights ( ORMUSA ) died to lay down people during the protests or carried out by the firing Angel Angel imagined when he was shot on April 21 .
Online censorship and intimidation of journalists and intimidation are increasingly growing .
Several independent online news agencies are reported by attacks on their websites , which were even brought into the midst of some cases .
This week , news sites have also been reported to report out their ad @-@ based digital networks , and with a pro @-@ pro @-@ pro @-@ pro @-@ pro @-@ regime movement .
Now , where the calls for a change is growing , they feel more difficult , considering the consequences of these measures , as access to information is just limited to information .
How everything began
The crisis began on April 18 , when the government - under President Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario , respectively , also recognized the country &apos;s president , and an example of the country &apos;s health system , which has been a case for 5 % and employers .
pensioners and students were quick to protest with peaceful demonstrations to protest the decision and saw police members of the &quot; young youth &quot; a shelter .
Then the chaos broke out .
Some protesters also reported that police have gone alive against them .
After the failed attempt to come through President installations to a peaceful resolution of the conflict , many are now demanding his resignation .
Gender attacks on journalists
Many journalists have been seen online since mid @-@ April and in real life with threats .
For example , a journalist for the daily daily newspaper La Prensa , who works as a journalist for the daily daily newspaper La Prensa on June 10 , <unk> .
The killers are being stolen in the killers , with members of local youth youth , and they stolen his passport and his mobile phones on his investigative work .
As it seems , the attackers wanted to threaten the attackers and prevent him from his work as a journalist .
Ze2red posted his statement on Facebook :
At the early morning , two men broke out in my house , and they took a <unk> and a pipe in her hand , and they demanded my mobile phone ( a <unk> of La Prensa ) , my <unk> and my documents , including my passport .
They beat me in the face and my lips <unk> .
They threw me out for outside the <unk> , usually there where my garbage is standing .
When one of them wanted to <unk> me with the <unk> , I asked him not to upset me , told the other of the two : &quot; Let him .
Let &apos;s hope he has learned , &quot; thank God , it &apos;s good .
However , I have no phone , that &apos;s why the whole communication is now taking place here .
Thanks to all those who have been driven and offered me to live with them .
God protect us from this regime .
This was not the first time it was attacked .
On May 9 , he and his colleagues were threatened with weapons of police officers .
Other journalists from La Ambulante , including <unk> Molina and military reinforcements , were attacked and their equipment were attacked by the crowd and police .
On June 8 , the studio of the state @-@ Radio Radio Nicaragua was on fire .
Chalkida on <unk>
Since many widely established media outlets , the Internet is being blamed as sources of information on the government &apos;s site as sources of information .
However , it will always be more difficult to inform .
This week , hundreds of people reported that their genital mutilation was changed in the middle of the night .
This <unk> alone alone , a <unk> of the Mexican Democratic Union of America .
The names of Internet networks have been changed as &quot; <unk> &quot; means &quot; # <unk> &quot; means &quot; # <unk> &quot; and is a nod to hit protesters .
This message was widely used online , as the hashtag is always used by government officials and government authorities .
In the country , more roads have been set up to put pressure on President Ortega and ordered him to move to the resignation of state violence .
Protesters are a road in the region of Nueva Guinea ( Nicaragua ) .

Without paper , electricity and News : Censorship in Venezuela continues · Global Voices
Screen capture of a depiction of the Catholic Eduardo Rapporteur on the censorship of the media in Venezuela .
Used with permission .
In the midst of protests against social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , state control has reached control of the coverage of new elections .
In June there , the Venezuelans had to have to block the Venezuelans such as PUMABydesign001 , pornographic websites and the Tor Tor websites , which have been blocked by the recent actions of an increasingly active strategy to restrict access to mainstream media .
The road was long and set up .
What during the late president of the late President Hugo Chávez , the limits of the access to Radio and Television began pressure on President Nicolás Maduro , many media outlets who have been conducted by the state and a potential impact on their pre @-@ commercial activities .
Recently , the National Assembly of National Assembly ( ANC ) passed the National Assembly ( ANC ) - a controversial law that has been linked to social media , a controversial law that has prompted social media to &quot; hate &quot; or removed .
If they have been heard that individuals were arrested because of tweets , it seems that it has already been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has been facing a shortage of goods and basic services , such as paper , electricity and <unk> .
This shortage , combined with political interference on public access to information and news regarding news , has been a different and highly controlled situation for communication .
Newspapers are going online ... and will then block
With the rapid rise in <unk> , local newspapers were forced to paper on paper , local newspapers ( especially the records of newspapers ) to stop their expenses , or to keep them online .
At the beginning of 2018 , a journalist tweeted :
It is reported that the <unk> of El Alto has been blocked in various locations .
I observed that in my computer , I observed that on my computer , La bruja and other Venezuelan websites who have been nominated for the dictatorship &quot; unpleasant &quot; for the dictatorship .
Do others have the problem ?
They can report for the complaint .
Months later , journalists reported on Twitter and other media that El Documentary , one of the most important newspapers in the country , was blocked :
This is how El Documentary concludes on the server :
&quot; It &apos;s not a scapegoat , it &apos;s about ban &quot;
Flickering Público , a organization that defends freedom of expression and access to information , condemned on their Twitter account that the government , streaming service providers , use web service , websites with sexual content such as MediaMetrics.ru and proxies .
The measure has prompted the public &apos;s attention and media in both and abroad .
Kuropurin shared showing what makes the authoritarian views of morality and belief :
The question raised here is how to be taken to this point .
Each thing that Chavism is a regime that Chavism is a regime that is slow but safe in all sectors of society .
Those who try to take him into the way we will have a full rule of society in the society .
Other users were quick to analyze the real reach of the measure and its ties with Internet censorship - a recent concern , not only in Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main problem is not just the block of pornographic pornographic pages , but it &apos;s already a disaster , but it &apos;s also on other sites .
What will they block ISIS block ?
They do the blocking of other pages that will happen suddenly .
However , other users , however , suspect that it doesn &apos;t matter about anything or more censorship .
They use broadband internet and the <unk> it to pay for the actual problem :
The block &apos;s blocking of porn sites is neither <unk> , nor has been created because the government wants to protect children .
The reason is that Venezuela has no money to pay the bandwidth to pay the bandwidth to access Internet access for Internet access .
What alternatives is there ?
Maybe gateway ... or not not .
Tor is an free software that is used to browse online , and it is possible to browse the web , and access to several reports online .
The blocking of various online sites on the network of Tor seems to be completely entirely effective .
Still , organizations like Acceso Libre or Microsoft Libre affirms that Tor was blocked .
They beat solutions to deal with the limitations :
We can confirm that Tor ( direct link ) is blocked by @ <unk> , you can use it to <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
It has been reported about blocking of the iceberg in Venezuela .
To bypass censorship , you can use bridges and Tor :
In light of the context , and the story , it reflects the projection of freedom of expression and access .
Many Venezuelans are asking what media or <unk> will be censored next to be censored and what can be done to be the government &apos;s actions .
Uganda Goes in Uganda is a serious threat to the environment

Environmental researchers in Uganda indicate that an important <unk> along the highway that has occupied the country &apos;s capital language along with the South Indian region .
The <unk> @-@ <unk> is a <unk> for several rivers that flow into forest <unk> and the holy sand as a symbol of water .
Since there is several land and water systems , fears that the <unk> - which is more than 12 meters in the depth of the map - the livelihoods of fish change or destroy the existence of the local fishermen .
The road of Kampala &apos;s heritage may also be measured by flooding as well as the tourist and regional Development Conference ( WWF ) on Twitter :
How has the nation has to be the <unk> between the offender and the <unk> of the water system to prevent the road both and flooded ?
Is it timely and transcribed reports from the park to check the movie &apos;s approach to the highway ?
There are regulations to control the block .
The National Security Company ( National Environment Monitor ) , however , has only a low budget budget to cut control by officials .
The Committee of the parliamentary panel for natural resources , Alex Kazakov , argues that it has helped protect the environment to protect the environment , and allow businesses to destroy the habitat of the land and forest industry :
It is the task of the economy to regulate activities in the field industry , but their misgivings are growing by the extent of environmental destruction in the areas where crossing the beach and in Miravalle .
Besides the vicious to end , it is also because it would &quot; adapt to work . &quot;
The water and environmental protection Ugandan minister explained that Ugandan minister is not stopped out of the sand , but it insists that all companies should not be stopped in the right way .
According to the Daily Monitor of the Daily Monitor , several government officials in order to stop the deep <unk> of more than 12 metres , but could not lead their activities for more than 12 metres :
So far , so far , coal director , Director @-@ Director , Director @-@ Director for monitoring , have been disrupted in the areas against their <unk> .
The vast majority of the sand made a distance from 12 metres of the sand , while the recommended three feet where the <unk> would quickly save themselves , so <unk> .
&quot; As part of our special coverage , we came to the <unk> and have stopped stopped but a few time later , our officials took back from financial obligations and they came back to a panel of the pro @-@ profit panel .
But this is not the only one : &quot; one of us had a precarious deal : &quot; one of us received a <unk> of 200 metres from the street in 200 metres from the street , but they don &apos;t keep it out , &quot; Salwa adds .
The <unk> of sand less than 200 meters from the street , a lot of <unk> , Uganda with Tanzania with Tanzania , illustrates regular flooding and growing struggles on the margins of the soil .
Twitter user <unk> X tells the statement of Ugandan police that all the vehicles of the vehicles must be a license of transport .
The question was followed by heavy electrical truck , the sand of <unk> <unk> .

Amnesia . )
I am a staunch supporter of the park ; it is far from being able to take away from his <unk> and gather new experiences .
This conviction is both both and intellectual .
So , when the opportunity for a temporary employment ( non @-@ governmental organisation ) , I packed my suitcase and made me to the way to Europe .
I didn &apos;t care about the big money that was always told , although the salary was expected .
As a result , no one wants to get out of a mine , and a rare source of how it is happening in a institution that is led by a white majority .
He was raised in Uganda and mainly in the African lakes , I had no good idea of what this would mean .
Even though I was familiar with the <unk> in Africa in Africa , the state of Moldova is familiar , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo in his film &quot; <unk> - <unk> <unk> &quot; was the experience of a minority .
Since the revelations of the Oxfam in Haiti , the international NGO staff has been paid for sex for sex , in the past few months , in the past few months .
Following the constant controversy , and a number of other <unk> in international media outlets , Angela Bruce clerics , who found large attention of the media in Haiti , has been one of the most advanced media projects , noted that the former Catholic Gulag for the humanitarian aid in Haiti .
But their articles , &quot; But they preferred to see your favorite <unk> &quot; ( &quot; but go until they &apos;re wearing black and racism until they see inclusion and racism in the war , &quot; she left inclusion and racism for me .
Other comments also made the comments of other black women from the sector , and the social exclusion that you must have to survive , were familiar .
I had international organizations to help and know the need of local people to be represented in these organizations .
I had already been complaining about the cartoons of Confused people , like the media .
This new opportunity to represent me in one of the world &apos;s biggest challenges for countries in all over the world - volatile migration .
But neither my education in gender questions , and even my experience had to prepare my experiences as well as a few hours ago , I had to prepare for this scenario .
Later , I learned that at a time , I was demanding the diversity ( instead of inclusion ) .
My dearest successor was sitting with me and sought for a fair African woman in the team .
A few months later , two small workers from Kenya and South Sudan had exclusively worked white to the service .
One day , our reasoning kept the only African <unk> in the yurt , and called us three to three African staff employees .
Perhaps the normal way of which employees were able to collect in this organization , but it was the first sign that things would not go smoothly .
We exchanged a deep smile with the managers and returned to our work .
That was the first time I was alone because of my skin skin colour .
To this day , I had no intention of harassment for the superiors .
But this example of <unk> racism and <unk> brought me the door and crying .
I cried , because these African woman escape the war and their mental health , she had fallen with a masters of the masters , and she was just with a masters of the masters to make up a man like this .
I cried , because I did not give it to my African colleague this message , and I was convinced it was my duty to protect them from such a community .
The factory was a white Europeans who had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was &quot; very suitable &quot; to report about the experiences of migrants - and you know that the group is about to report a majority of migrants : &quot; poor Africans &quot; like I heard about different occasions .
For these people , we were ambivalent of African <unk> , not people with skills that deserve their job .
In the team , there was the most white woman in the team .
Let &apos;s take care of what this woman was brought to meetings with meetings .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should take part in a particular meeting that I wasn &apos;t able to be a lot of work on my desk .
Within 30 minutes , the visits was in my door and demanded that I go to the meeting , and suggested that I would not disagree with this woman .
I was surrounded by privileges by the White Helmets .
The role of this white woman in the racist and <unk> environment was very clear .
She was the one who decided if a contract was extended to the hard round of Kenya to the hard round .
I cannot include how often I received calls , and a real # true way of abuse for me because one thing was not brought to the end .
And <unk> , if someone from another Amazonian newspaper also praised my efforts .
Vaccination programs were <unk> .
The letters expressed tribute to his animosity of women who all know - those who all know - and not <unk> remarks about these women .
Although most of the community members of the middle @-@ language community who knew this man , there were never chance to address the issue .
While work has been interesting , I had a lot to pay , and I had to pay for ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract at another branch , but my <unk> ordered me that I stayed first .
The fact that I had received a contract without his coup , leaving him his worst act .
I shared a office with another white <unk> who <unk> his calls to <unk> loudspeakers , who started calling for me to call myself and call me with all sorts of <unk> .
I learned from others that the plan was to push me to stop what I had to find .
But I had a digital system from the country .
I had managed to build employee in <unk> relationships , although she usually started a mention of the coup of the coup .
But all that was happening , as long as I was not grateful to the superiors and <unk> .
The apparent harassment and military intervention led to two colleagues to leave their job ; a man who has been denied a <unk> , and was denied a <unk> because of the White branch of the branch .
We tried to report these racism and sexism .
Senior high @-@ high colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something , because &quot; he has good connections with the Big Prosecution system in the blogosphere . &quot;
There was also pointless about the clinic too .
Recently , a recent colleague of the sugar department assured me that it would be as a consultant to report the events because I would risk a bad point .
Given all of these obstacles and limitations , I decided to leave the organization after a year to get a appropriate writ and justice .
But sorry , I was depressed .
Women are less than 30 percent of all workers in a sector where women are involved in the sector , and I hope that the discussions about # <unk> will encourage the scale of racism and abuse in the development of aid .
Officials need to find solutions for the inclusion - not only in the sense , more people of minorities and women , but ensure that it is true policies , <unk> practices and opportunities to stop such abuses .

The jungles of Calais - once helpful for Refugees , a Wildlife Wildlife Wildlife Sanctuary · Global Voices

The local authorities decided to make this place to a <unk> , and <unk> him as a &quot; ecological and solar power &quot; - this is the only way to read how to read through <unk> and the presence of birds , for example .
But there are speculation that the actual motivation of this project is to remove undesirable people from the city , and not the richness and fauna of the territory .
There are nothing else than <unk>
Since the &quot; jungle &quot; since the &quot; jungle , &quot; the French authorities also started similar projects in other parts of Calais .
It is aims to turn a small forest cover , a small forest cover that lives in a park to turn out that forests is still accessible , while the effort will be closed .

These actions are usually taking place in the night or sit @-@ up , with no warning and <unk> .
The refugees are not only abandoned by the refugees , but also their personal possessions confiscated their personal possessions , including minors of police brutality , including minors .

There are a lot of political crisis in Bangladesh that many people are forced to see .
The inhabitants of Calais are outraged that there are so bad that these people are treated there , and also about the poor picture that is written by her city .
It doesn &apos;t really matter about the camp or migrants , but it &apos;s not a solution for the plight of these people .

Rape Rape in the camps · Global Voices
For more than two decades of civil war and Famine , many people in Somalia had to leave their home and stay in mud .
Women and girls living in camps outside major cities are mostly affected by sexual assault .
They are vulnerable , and most rape are in the middle of the night , or when they gather maps in remote locations .
During the same time , victims have not been able to raise a legal counsel , but it would be necessary to gain justice for them .
Furthermore , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old single mother , mother and resident of Harley Ba &apos; Guayacan camp in Xinjiang , was raped at the eyes of her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) , she described the attack :
It was midnight when a armed man in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in my semi @-@ <unk> neighborhoods was violently dispersed and raped .
He raped me not only , but I also raped me with a heavy wound on my body , which is still very pain today .
At night &apos;s night , men of the police officer arrived in the semi @-@ square camp in the mud @-@ IDP camp , which is located in central city .
The men set up to monitor the tents and rapidly monitor a other .
Both women were raped and continue to wait for her high injuries .
They arrested the attacker , however , not charged with a court for their crimes .
According to human rights organizations , a independent government official in the region were reported in 2017 in 2017 , according to reports that 80 cases of rape cases were reported .
However , the real number of rape cases remain higher , as many victims do not take a complaint - from fear of <unk> , <unk> trust and access to the necessary health facilities .
Aside from the issues of prosecution , health agencies and lack of medical equipment and medical equipment that needed in this sector need to be another obstacle for survivors of sexual assault .
According to health health , there is also plenty of doctors to circumvent rape cases .
Japanese culture also cannot stand for justice , as a local custom would accept their attacker or &quot; camels &quot; as compensation for the attack :
rapes are ubiquitous and remain in a wide range of publications , as there are a decades of thousands of loss , since there has been a decades of violence in conflict and threatened with the law .
The tradition states rape rape - often camels , or animals - accept their attackers as part of a non @-@ partisan practice that <unk> the war between rival tribes in the country .
Small steps in the right direction - but it &apos;s enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 , the most recent region of the country &apos;s first forensic laboratories that has faced the first forensic laboratories of cases of rape cases .
A year earlier , in September 2016 , in September 2016 , the country &apos;s first fifth @-@ <unk> law passed a anti @-@ vegan bill , which has been investigating its support by 42 members of the bill , which was later officially submitted to a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the state of the federal state was Somaliland , and also proposed a new anti @-@ anti @-@ terrorism bill .
However , it will still take place until this draft bill , the second house of parliament , decided to be passed from the elders , decided to be passed .
Although the problem of rape in recent years has been exacerbated by the international government and the international community , sexual violence against women and children continue to continue increasing violence against women and children .
Argentina : The hour to the End of gentrification for Drug Crimes · Global Voices
The &quot; green flood &quot; - the name of the head of legalizing <unk> - before the Argentinian Congress .
Photo taken from the Facebook page of the National Campaign for a Right to a &quot; legal , safe and research , &quot; which has been shared online .
On June 13 , the Parliament of Parliament decided to push over a draft bill to legalize the bill &apos;s legislators .
Officially , the debate has already started in March - an historic milestone in the long struggle for the long struggle of rights in Argentina .
Before the last week , the two months of both vote and opponents were included .
In the wake of the debate , the bill was adapted in some points to win the voices of parliament .
Among the most important changes , the ability for doctors to carry out of electric weapons , however , are obligated to be obligated to have adequate staff that should be required .
In addition , women need the approval of their parents or their guardians .
Meanwhile , more than yet another debate , and offline , several human rights organizations and civil society groups have been held in support of the National Campaign for a right to promote a legal , safe and free abortion in the Congress of Congress .
Her message reads &quot; <unk> to have a election ; to avoid abortion in order to avoid abortion ; legal abortion . &quot;
At the same time , different religious organizations have also demonstrated the slogan &quot; Both lives &quot; against the law .
A vigil in front of the Congress was planned for June 13 while sitting inside the presidential candidate .
Various surveys show that large parts of the population support the bill .
Independent journalist Eduardo Margoso , a Liberian journalist , expressed a victim of his testimony on Twitter , but was also displeased with the outcome :
&quot; poll , you &apos;re for or against legal , safe and research , &quot; for instance ?
The analysis of the legislator &apos;s analysis of the legislator , however , shows a somewhat majority against legalizing .
However , in many cases , however , it is unclear how the legislators are going to vote , either because the legislators are not quiet , or because of fear or threats rather than to keep threats or threats .
The last day of the official debate was compiled by a powerful speech by the Ministry of Health for candor :
We have been living in a democracy for 35 years .
Abortion is a subject that is happening under the scene .
The evidence are clear : a decriminalization is turning into less maternal than less abortion .
How to take action in any way .
If the bill is adopted by the law , the Senate becomes submitted to the Senate , where there is a clear majority against the ocean .
However , this trend could change , even after the result of the debate in the house space , where the female members play a crucial role .
&quot; I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf in the congress
It is impossible to ignore the influence of public opinion in the polls , but also in different personal stories that are distributed online .
In one of these reports , a woman has been in effect on the legal and indirect obstacles to which they faced themselves as she needed a medical exit .
She calls the names of doctors not in public , but she describes how some refused to help her and how a medical doctor demanded a money for the operation :
My head and my body didn &apos;t have yet to quit .
I still felt the same fear in the moment when I was taking care of the help and medical practitioners and medical practitioners I had needed to shop .
If I slept , I had a great name of Dr. N. and Dr N. and Dr B. And I &apos;ve always been able to see him again at the Congress .
She concludes :
I feel that I &apos;ve felt much risks in the past few days .
I have a couple of friends who <unk> me as they would keep my hand , even in this day , I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf in the Congress and asked him to vote for legalizing <unk> .
On Twitter , users have been able to express opinions and diverse opinions in favor of the bill :
The UN has defined the criminalization of abortion as an afterthought .
If the law will not be adopted , all parliamentarians who voted against this torture and the potential deaths .
They will become every single woman , who shook the conscience .
Abortion will be done , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just in cases of legal abortion , if not , they have time that they &apos;ve done the legs , &quot; he does not want to punish women , &quot; which just doesn &apos;t want to punish women , or you just want to punish women ?
Targeted or illegal abortion , this is the question .
If the law might be adopted , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America to legalize the global trend of legalization or delivery .
The first country in the region that made this step was Uruguay .
In the meantime , the <unk> was <unk> on the national state of Latin America .
Let &apos;s be the country we want to be .
A country without corruption that is integrated in the world , with a full scare @-@ building , social dialogue , social dialogue , and legal abortion .

But <unk> , you say you are going to take the demonstrations , then we will be unpleasant . &quot; But the person on me is being unpleasant , and I &apos;m still witnessing it , &quot; but I &apos;m still witnessing a few minutes .
&quot; Well , Sarmad , Sarmad , will we hear this , &quot; he plays a video where I see as participants at a demonstration , &quot; you listening to the Sarmad ?
We don &apos;t treat anybody .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Tejar , a thought of my head in my head : she says , she says that Al Shafee &apos;s musical broadcasts was viral .
Then it can only be <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of the speeches .
Now he begins to speak the only language that he understood , and <unk> <unk> , with a few short periods .
To the end , it &apos;s a hour , I guess .
I return to my cell .
A quarry is necessary to let me go .
Since the first time , I feel , I feel when I have a state <unk> in his ban .
With their head and <unk> hands , we give the same way to one like every morning .
The same <unk> <unk> of the walls .
I <unk> my breath , my breath was removed because of my <unk> , &quot; if you don &apos;t stop the Krach , &quot; if you don &apos;t stop it !
Or you want to do that ? &quot; must be busy with something else .
I &apos;m slowly going to be slowly , so gone out .
I am shaking with fear or a cold ?
Ah , the difference , or so I don &apos;t hear my teeth .
Then I can finally go home and release you to go home .
Who was still filming ?
How did you pick up the filming with the filming ?
Is there still something we know ?
I mean , we know everything , but I &apos;d like to hear from your mouth . &quot;
No time to think ; ever you answer , the less doubt she <unk> , the fewer doubt .
I could have everything that I have done nothing .
I think they are doing this country well , &quot; he says , will be the eyes of going free .
I &apos;m wonder , you have to realize that you can see now again .
Visit me , Sarmad , you are still young , and you have your entire future before you .
We can all open all the doors of the nose , we can also open thousands of doors .
The decision is to make you up with you and take this mobile phone here ; Call you on Facebook or in this Yahoo , or where you &apos;re looking for your videos , and you tell me to be able to be able to be able to move here . &quot;
In such a moment , every single sentence was given by the head of the two detainees who told the other prisoners to her <unk> .
The value of your life is tied with the people around you .
You &apos;re running up to follow YOU - who is supposed to be a case in danger , and who can be sacrificed if there &apos;s no other else else ?
My mother talked often of &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t want to leave his enemy enemy , &quot; and I wouldn &apos;t like any one of them .
&quot; I use my e @-@ mail account only for ordinary .
Since , please me log in me , &quot; after several <unk> on my neck , I &apos;ve got the <unk> password for these situations ( I used to make extra a false account ) , forming the third attempt .
To online web websites , online and dozens online online .
None of it , &quot; Do you care about a portable user or what ?
Do you know what &apos; <unk> &apos; means what ?
No problem . &quot;
He squeezes me to my eyes , given me , dispel his stuff from the table and leaves the room .
For a few minutes , without that one of my <unk> is not a <unk> , no whip , no whip , I have <unk> my life .
Then the door go down . &quot;
He <unk> me in a attempt to let me know me .
Go out of my feet after the above .
The screams break away from me .
He continues to go back to me with me to make a sound sweet water <unk> .
This is how I can wait for hours , <unk> and I can hear a drink he was prepared .
It smells it smells of cigarettes ; where we are not allowed not not allowed , he owns the <unk> on my back .
I &apos;m fed down , and he &apos;ll go to me - under the conditions that I can keep myself without help .
After several attempts I trust me and I walked back into my cell .
I &apos;m going to take place in powerlessness .
This is just a <unk> system of a broad system in which thinking thinking about crime and the strangers of criminals that belonged to the crime .
It is a system that wants to make us the illusion of freedom of freedom - one of the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship , because they lived the truth .
Sarmad , you cannot sleep all day you have to sleep and wash you . &quot; The voice belongs to Abdel Rahman .
I have given me up to the short moment in which I &apos;ve been Anaïs dead , until the evening of the next day , &quot; they &apos;re quiet , either they try to get you elsewhere or they &apos;re free .
Like all , &quot; he says , with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from Daka , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smile never leaves his face when he talking about it .
In the end , he worked in the forum in Riyadh , and the chance he received many books .
In a raid , several banned books were spotted in him - and a few pictures he found as demonstrator .
The occasion is enough to arrest him .
There are a few new prisoners next day .
All of them talk about a certain <unk> that was beaten in a pocket near our backs . &quot; They had to get in the leg to arrest him .
And then he has <unk> the <unk> with a knife and her life , &quot; one of the <unk> , clearly impressed by the <unk> .
He continues : &quot; He &apos;s big and strong . &quot;
Another few hours , just a few hours .
We all turn up as possible as possible to the tiny hole in the door to catch a glimpse of the catch , a <unk> young man , selling his neck , a <unk> young man , and on his throat .
The guards are afraid of him !
They address him .
We <unk> in unfair silence , hoping to hear what it was just to hear .
Nothing !
It sounded from our routine , <unk> fate .
Culturally , when they brought him into the clinic .
The time passes without any word .
It &apos;s worthwhile to return to his previous job , so you don &apos;t do anything , but do you have a different choice if there is nothing to do except and <unk> ?
The door on the ground will be <unk> .
The steps of the <unk> gets closer .
Our cell will open and <unk> .
Then the door ended .
We wait until the guards continues and washing wounds .
Besides , when we are stuck somewhere in this distant countries , we are now cooking fires , and would be protected by it .
But as a human beings you &apos;re traveling , until you are in the series ; either you &apos;re looking for her wounds or her .
It &apos;s an hour , because it has already been raising awareness .
Then he takes his hand on the <unk> !
This is more than a window to a grave ; only the guards and his <unk> use him .
None of us had so far <unk> .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was a pretty young young man and a lot of women in my nose .
Can it be your sister under them ?
Is this evil to me ?
Or have I talk about the ass , and you have since been on my blood ?
If you just said , we would be able to move peacefully .
No reason to give you these anger . &quot;
Specialist <unk> and laughs .
I could tell the hearts of other people from her magical cousin , and I was almost safe , and I was almost a God .
We knew from the beginning that we could die .
Then we chase them at least one box .
Or do you think that these killers are about us so many people kill us because we are afraid of them ?
Tiny , they are more afraid of us than we were talking . &quot;
He clearly speaks loud to hear the guards .
Three of them beat the door on and visits in the cell .
They beat themselves as <unk> on <unk> and address him out .
It should be the last time I see <unk> in the military warehouse of Deir cells .

Same @-@ sex &apos; Rights &quot; as Separate Love as Cuban Activist Strips Youth · Global Voices
&quot; If I am out of a completely convinced , the love we &apos;re equal in the same sense of legitimate partners like the love of heterosexual couples . &quot;

Sada Tangara is a young activist and science engineer based on Facebook with &quot; organising a agenda for sexual diversity in Cuba &quot; ( <unk> for <unk> in Cuba ) a space for discussions and discussions .
Recently , his work began as a activist after his experiences as a human rights defender for educators and cultural rights for the National Center for Peace ( UCAB .
For two years , he served a project dedicated to the University of computer and rights in Havana , and the name &quot; Love at a Second conversation &quot; ( Love on the second glance ) .
In 2014 , he was here to participate in Latin America and the Caribbean Administration of International Lesbian Organization , <unk> , retweets and <unk> Association ( <unk> , World Human Rights Council ) , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Association .
At the moment , he is a member of the Oscar Prosecutor &apos;s Center , Romero Center , where he works with people who worked with social equality .
The interviews of the interview is the current debate in Cuba for all those who are not recognized by the country &apos;s constitution .
In our conversation , many interesting aspects of the debate came into the debate , on the level of meaning the human rights movement , gay transgender , transgender , bisexual , bisexual , and intersex ( <unk> ) communities to protect the lives of citizens .
Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should people be able to legalize the same <unk> in Cuba in your opinion ?
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think it should be a legal use of law .
Especially because there is a lot of legal events , including those who are based with UCP &apos;s misplaced property , based on the law and recognized by the law .
Like that , like that , it is marriage for all , <unk> <unk> or something else , it will depend on what our revolutionaries propose and overcome our ability to overcome the obstacles .
In international international terms , there are several countries that are in favor of their justice .
We don &apos;t have the first step in Cuba .
I personally don &apos;t think that a legally <unk> contract <unk> a emotional stability of a relationship , and it can help protect the heritage and do not want to avoid wrong .
Depending on the scope of legal law , the right to adoption for adoption .
It &apos;s a issue about only a few people in Cuba .
It is complicated and not free of ethical questions .
GV : Do you think , a national referendum will be required to determine whether sex partnerships between people of the same gender / <unk> in Cuba should be supposed to be ?
<unk> : I personally think that the right of people should not be subjected to <unk> statements , not even the majority .
However , there are some legal events that cannot be ignored .
For example , the marriage system is defined in the Cuban Constitution ( Article 36 ) as &quot; an volunteer substitute volunteer between a man and a woman who legally sees legally to live . &quot;
The <unk> of this <unk> communities .
Some important adjustments could be implemented here for recognition of recognition on recognition of recognition , rather than recognition of an national marriage , not without a national term .
This second option seems to be the <unk> , but it &apos;s only a limited reach .
If they are collaborating with adoption , marriage would always be a fundamental right / privilege for couples of gender @-@ sex marriage while same @-@ sex community must be satisfied with a competitor and <unk> community .
But I should highlight that a human rights record between people of the same sex is only a point in the agenda of sexual diversity .
Therefore , I should think about the idea of any legal initiative , and the agenda below can be found with relevant views by activists and organizations .
Regarding marriage , <unk> said :
I think it &apos;s girls .
With the story of the story , marriage , coal and Jewish Christian double double standards .
I <unk> the decision to give you a chance to give you a chance , but I believe the debate has not reached the <unk> that they should have .
That &apos;s why I would like to ask about the future about future debates in the room :
Why is the equality behind marriage in so many headlines ?
What place should she look at the agenda of sexual diversity ?
Is it sense to fight equality for marriage , just because the right ?
What is the real owners of this law ?
If we talk about marriage for equal couples , this is only the relationship between two people ?
What happens to the <unk> relationship ?
Should their views be re @-@ <unk> ?
What kind of sex change is changing by marriage , which has access to medicines and solar power policy ?
Will the marriage change for a lesbian woman who wants to do for a human being in Cuba ?
Because the representation of the Ministry of Public health is not enough for medical couples , it would not be enough to be a couple of money .
GV : Is you a case or a <unk> in Cuba where people learned that not the protection of the protection of the law ?
Glad : I are many cases .
One of them is a friend that has been sharing her together with the death of the death of his partner .
It &apos;s a terrible story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased had written him from the house .
After his death , almost all of his father &apos;s father has been all over .
Since the community was not recognized , it was almost no legal status .
Moreover , there are no large number of people ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) for couples working for couples who have failed to remain @-@ sex couples .
GV : Two years ago , a commenter named Chief of the Communist Party of Cuba issued the following comment : &quot; Same marriage to do is nonetheless with the society , and it would be the same way the recognition of <unk> between human and animals .
It should not be legal because it is not normal .
There are couples who spend their entire lives without allowed to accept what is not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer such a way ?
Unbelievable : At all , I do not want to highlight the comment on the site , which reads on May 6 , 2014 , was published in the online edition of <unk> .
In recent article , journalist emeritus of the International Co @-@ secretary of the International Lesbian Conference , <unk> retweets , Tencent and reactionary Association ( <unk> ) , tracked up .
Source :
It &apos;s his opinion and I respect them but I respect his great ignorance about the issue .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is the relative relative of course .
What a normal and of course is , it may not seem to be and vice versa .
It &apos;s long time for the story of the story .
During the times of slavery , the buying of a people was &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course , &quot; something of what today is the agreement .
If there is no doubt I am convinced that the love we are capable of common people , as the love that we explain , legitimate people are different .

The decision has sparked national and international outrage in and led to <unk> protests and protests .
Earlier , the Commission ruled Morales and members of his family in corruption , specifically the <unk> of illegal <unk> in the room , therefore Morales and his number of whom have been held for the Constitutional Court .

According to a official law , Morales could approve the court &apos;s decision to approve legal action to the President &apos;s ouster .
Journalists like Nina Moughal and other commenters are watching the current situation and the different procedural scenarios of precisely , especially if Morales should request the court &apos;s decision and demand the army :

As <unk> seen / in the context of the constitution , it is not possible to ignore the ruling @ <unk> President @ <unk> , or not allowed .
What will he do and his network of the elite ?

Human rights activists , including the human rights group <unk> , responded with relief and belongings , but also with concern regarding the government &apos;s next steps and offices :
The news of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It had to come .
The <unk> Constitutional Court makes public order again .
What could happen next 48 hours when trying to return to Guatemala ?
A political deja vu ?
Given the long and tough fight against corruption and political turmoil in Guatemala , these events have become very special significance .
This is how the political rise of Morales has been opposed to a crime against corruption and impunity , which took part in the former nation &apos;s resignation and that 2015 will have the resignation of former President Otto Pérez Molina .
In the political crisis 2015 , the presence of the commission and its investigation was expected to be a crucial role in the country &apos;s political crisis .
Now , he is still under the center of political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is as an important moment in Guatemala regarding the protection of its democratic institutions , either a big step .
Salvadoran journalist Héctor Silva points out what he refers to Morales &apos;s <unk> &quot; and Morales &apos; President :
Jimmy Morales took the presidency in Guatemala with support @-@ <unk> groups , including some with links to military orders .
When he took on , he said he was neither a thief nor corrupt .
Today , he is a president that <unk> from <unk> power to prevent corruption against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # <unk> ( &quot; resignation &quot; ) , which has been used in the protests during the protests , again , and will be organized on street protests .
At the same time , international media has highlighted international media as the Colombian newspaper El Universo the importance of the crisis in Guatemala and called the international community to follow further developments in the country :
Regardless of <unk> changes , the situation caused the tension that have come out in this country and that <unk> a sore point has hit the issue without a rocky investigation .
This is why the international community must protect the people of Guatemala to protect its institutions and search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be held in Guatemala , as the result of this year , could be a huge impact on the history of all sorts of entire hemisphere .

In the hills of the northern <unk> in western India , the community &apos;s community is a peaceful and difficult life .
From the hills resounds the Echo of songs that resounds the <unk> for each .
They are no average villagers who have been living decades in the same place , and have provided a reliable reliable facility .
The bails are rather nomads , like their name suggests that &quot; <unk> &quot; is <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of <unk> &quot; or &quot; people of Scotland . &quot;

The <unk> in Sikkim saw many challenges facing climate change , such as climate change , environmental insecurity , economic insecurity , and economic instability , economic insecurity and central life .
Since the 1960s , when inadequate borders have been closed , these challenges increased .
In a sense , a cultural struggle is a constant battle , with the result that the number of people who are willing to take traditional lives to take the traditional lives to take place .
Before 1962 , the practice of Tibet , where she was originally born in the northern areas of Sikkim , in the northern areas of Sikkim to leave their <unk> .
In Tibet , she has temporarily been carried out near physical neighborhoods in Tibet , where the grass burst on the ground , and was not <unk> through the weight of snow .
In the summer , they moved south into the northern region of the northern Sikkim and remained some time in areas like angelcaido , <unk> , <unk> , and laughter .
There was those who hail from the laughter of laughter with the <unk> Valley that is not only economically , but also culturally responsible for both sides of both sides .
The trade wore cultural exchange for cultural exchange and <unk> the peaceful respect of the two communities .
In exchange , the ability to get the cattle from the brain and legend riches that left left after taking their own , closely <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> community , <unk> and livestock .
This exchange has been created by the agreement between Tibet and India , as well as the open borders that allow the real permitted to be free .
Following the occupation of China &apos;s occupation , the border closed , and the military attacks were forced to relocate into one of the two sides .
Since then , their 5 spots have been reduced to a region , both in winter and the summer .

This has resulted in a <unk> of the equation , and the heat is preparing to address the problem in the main complaints .
The wild animals will be forced to <unk> them to sell them either or to sell them to sell them , as the grass winter in winter .
This is an additional edition to buy the park .
For the traditional <unk> community , this is relatively new right for the <unk> of their daily demand for their daily demand , and their stock industry <unk> .
Since the time , the community needs to leave the army when it needs to be critical of medical help , even if the army can &apos;t afford to help the army &apos;s hard health .
In such cases , the simple survival is difficult .
To understand the <unk> , you need to see that the <unk> is a central role in the ideal way of life , and you add milk and milk milk to different products , such as <unk> .
From the wool , things like <unk> , clothes and <unk> .
In previous times , expensive varieties , <unk> , and <unk> , from the wool , who were mostly harassed in Tibet , and was used as a suicide activist .
Due to the <unk> is a majority of deal .
The Soligas &apos; dresses is mostly known for tea - in this area , <unk> , and in the summer of the summer .
However , after their taxes , the country was usually sold in the places where it sold in places where he has become a short businessman .
After all these years , the Maenads are still considered guests and not as the residents .
They are trapped and to be careful , not only because their herds might be resolved , but also because they can do with the rules and regulations of the national communities .

Young men have also been back to Employment before they probably could not find a bride bride .
Those who end the profession in the heart of the city , most frequently positions in the army , or other urban urban jobs .
With the latest surge in tourism in India , jobs are asked to ask in this sector .
Those who are not able to find a job more than the last resort in Tibetan @-@ Sultan .
Neither did not support the support of some of the government &apos;s not non @-@ Malay organizations for young people to fight the traditional way of life of life .
Despite all this , there are those who <unk> the traditional activity of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of Sikkim .
But even they are aware of the conditions of the conditions , they realize that their children could be able to sell livestock in cities and other opportunities .

And that was the only reason I think I am still alive .
The art didn &apos;t help me thought it would be healthy , but I helped me that I could send my voice to people outside the camp .
It was the art I saved me , it was the art that saved my life .
His cartoon attracted attention to the attention of medical traders and the <unk> , first on the ground , before his cartoon .
Later , Australian media took part in his art in the aftermath of emergency negotiations :
