In different places , especially in West Africa , migration has been &quot; <unk> &quot; such as <unk> .
The migration is seen as a normal strategy to find migration as a normal strategy in the country or migration in neighboring countries - the most common type of migration , especially in West Africa , or if you are traveling more and more distance . &quot;
Europe is not always the goal of the migration .
Mikle1 comments :
Those travel often have no place as a goal .
You can remain on a distance for half a time to work and earn money .
After that , it &apos;s going to continue to continue another place for some time .
Or you will be deported from the country .
The whole thing is more and more exciting than the <unk> way to Europe , when he is as often represented .
Without work and economic opportunities , it will be considered the <unk> decision to leave home and search to better ways .
However , as a young man &apos;s decision to do the decision , &quot; They hope to do that , &quot; they hope to do what is a <unk> , responsible person , and for their family .
And young people are often expects to be expected for their parents and other family members . &quot;
Judge agrees : &quot; It &apos;s about to improve the situation home .
Among the youth in Mali are the narrative of the people in Mali .
There is a legal sense that the political system of youth will help . &quot;
In order for the young people that can be expected , they will be expecting their ability to take their lives as adults , they are hoping to be hope outside her country .
As long as the situation in their home country , the young people will turn to the way to other places , and the young people insist on the way .
&quot; It will be OK , &quot; says who ?
The &quot; It will be OK &quot; to &quot; <unk> &quot; the young Palestinians in their country .
But who can be able to be the state , guarantee that the current situation will be okay ?
Like many other campaigns of the EU , the video is entirely related to the potential and mentioned conditions that the young people in their home country are not explicitly <unk> .
The idea is : &quot; If they want to stay in the <unk> of the message at home , they would have some of the opportunity to show some of the options there . &quot;

&quot; Without identity , you are not non @-@ citizens , &quot; says Evgeny Van &apos;s administrator , the UNHCR representative in Georgia .

The viral social media campaign # <unk> ( # <unk> , like # <unk> ) forced China &apos;s most popular social media platform Weibo .
This move does not mean that LGBT voices are not to silence online , but there &apos;s no significant disconnect from the other hand .
On April 13 , Weibo plans set up to crack down a harsh crackdown on cartoons , Games and football plans to address China &apos;s PRISM law , which monitors ideological control and &quot; socialist <unk> &quot; as Armenia factors .
A direct figure on LGBT content is not the law .
The company explained clearly that LGBT content would have been affected , and has already closed down the issue of <unk> recorded and 62 <unk> .
On the next day , LGBT figures published &quot; LGBT <unk> &quot; ( so like &quot; LGBT votes &quot; ) , a popular statement on Weibo :
As of conditions outside our control , editorial content will be suspended indefinitely on Weibo on Weibo .
During that time , we will not use our official Weibo account of LGBT non @-@ LGBT websites .
I want to thank all Weibo users who have been supporting us since 2009 .
Each comment , including and Share is a voice for love .
Let &apos;s hope for a better tomorrow .
The article above has been shared more than Arifur times .
A large number of Weibo users started following the news to post the hashtag # <unk> as a protest against censorship .
In less than a week , the hashtag has been used in less than 500 million calls .
censors attempted to stop through the removal of RosUznik , the protest , but did not meet the protests and the foreign media users who are taking place .
The newspaper People &apos;s Daily published the newspaper People &apos;s Daily ( a official representative of the Chinese Communist Party ) on April 15 , a memorandum that <unk> LGBT content that LGBT content will not be present , with a stable , or <unk> content .
On the next day and her statements on the other day , it was not an anti @-@ government action against LGBT @-@ content content in one of the three months , opting for censorship , pornographic , or violent content .
According to LGBT figures , LGBT <unk> participated in a statement on April 16 :
Thank you for many , thank you for your voice .
What happened in the past 48 hours is that it &apos;s possible to reduce the voice of the vote .
The blog of @ LGBT <unk> can continue their work on 48 hours - thanks to you in 48 hours .
The hashtag # <unk> we &apos;ve called for more than 500 million times for more than 500 million times .
It was the most popular LGBT issue against discrimination against discrimination in China .
Within 48 hours , 10 hours reported outside of the incidents of the events and the youth People &apos;s Daily , and the Supreme People &apos;s Daily presented its decision to <unk> its decision and will not be found on the list of <unk> @-@ content content .
All this should be done .
With our page the LGBT community is strong .
We will continue to combat healthy scientific and without LGBT content , so that the public can bring a sense of <unk> and understanding of our community .
This is the best way to make discrimination .
LGBT <unk> will remain his mission and the Chinese LGBT community .
However , this is only an obstacle for the road to the road .
The company &apos;s <unk> was not an isolated case , but the company was an inhuman mistake .
This led by internet pressure pressure .
LGBT content has already been focused on the focus of <unk> in recent years .
WeChat user @ Freedom @-@ 404 documented the following <unk> on LGBT content ( via China Digital Times ) :
March 2018 : A review of the award @-@ winning film reveals me by your name on the Beijing Film Festival .
The film , which tells the love of a homosexual couple , won the Oscar for the best adapted script , and was also nominated in the Best Best Film , Best Nature and Best Weblog .
On May 2017 , Colombia &apos;s local native language recently hosts a series of support for homophobia to divest and advance the show .
In June 2017 : Online News providers ( so , as &quot; affiliated &quot; service providers ) , a policy created by online platforms , require content of sexual behavior such as machismo , homosexuality , sexual violence , sexual violence , and <unk> .
Shortly after online , online platforms , including courses and Youku parts of their LGBT content .
July 2017 : When feminist researcher Li Haiping , her voice for the LGBT community was blocked for three months .
July 2015 : a popular online video forum , &quot; I &apos;m thinking about my parents there ? &quot; was said by the State Administration of Press , Cinetecavirtual.cl , Radio and Television of China ( about China , film and Television ) .
The official justification for the ban was that the guests are &quot; <unk> &quot; that the guests are &quot; <unk> &quot; and that the program values and morality .
The decision of LGBT <unk> and the <unk> of LGBT <unk> will be very different , but it does not mean that LGBT content will remain in the next <unk> .

While the campaign enters the <unk> of the state of emergency in the country , the third year of the state party is stepping down in the wake of the political drama of the political fear .
Usually , action should represent the promise and visions of a specific candidate or a candidate for any party .
But this is when Turkish democracy is questioned by the state of credibility and the election is very different .
The country has been in a state of emergency for almost 24 months in the state of exception in July 2016 , with the government &apos;s government , as opposed by Erdogan &apos;s arch @-@ corruption agency , as opposed to Erdogan &apos;s arch @-@ nemesis .
President Erdogan , the candidate of the ruling party for Justice and Development ( AKP ) , has been in power since 2002 , has been in power since 2002 , after he was a few months before he was elected in 2014 .

The public service was also like the military , the judiciary , and the science of supposed anti @-@ democracy opponents .
Wikipedia , the largest online encyclopedia of the world is currently blocked within the country .
This is not surprising that Erdogan &apos;s fatwa is difficult to find it difficult for a electorate from nearly 60 million voters , including 1.5 million new voters , including 1.5 million new voters .
Erdogan denies that the generous narratives that have received its campaign from national channels and other pro @-@ government mainstream media under the current state of emergency .
&quot; Give me a example .
Where and the campaign has blocked a state of emergency ? , &quot; he asked this week in his home town in the Black Sea in Northern Turkey .
He also suggested that the state of emergency could be lifted after the elections .
It is a general fact that the most important country is to recognise President Erdogan &apos;s online discourse .
However , his opponents were quick by him .
This exchanges is not only a curious relief of a tense political atmosphere , but also offers an important insights into what Erdogan &apos;s election , its three main opponents and the Turkish voters really is important .

In a prominent example , Erdogan has used Erdogan &apos;s growth to the growth of the annual economy in Turkey since the <unk> of AKP as a metric of the economic progress of its party .
No time and suggested that the Turkish word for refrigerator , <unk> the Turkish word for refrigerator , broadcast in Turkish Twitter :
Erdogan at a rally in Mpila , an industrial district of Istanbul , protested from Istanbul : &quot; How many <unk> were sold ( then in 2002 ) ?
How much is the sale of selling money now ?
It means that ( the people aren &apos;t there ) .
If there is a refrigerator here in every house - <unk> - then the wealth has to be everywhere .
The advent of Erdogan &apos;s involvement : the refrigerator has been for 40 years .

The answer was crucial , as a majority of Erdogan &apos;s hope to win a victory in the first round of his first round in the first round of affairs .

In the midst of protests against the social , political and economic crisis in Venezuela , the state government has reached new control of new labour projects .
In June 2018 , Venezuelans had to determine such as Libroscompartidos.com ( SPD ) , such as <unk> , pornographic websites , and Tor Tor , the latest measure of establishing access to information access to public citizens .
The way was long and rolling .
As the result of the late president Hugo Chávez has been linked to Radio and television with president Nicolás Chávez , many media outlets have been held in a business model that has been previously conducted previously previously conducted by the state and commercial influence in the country , where the state <unk> and commercial activities .
Furthermore , the National Assembly of National Constituent Assembly ( ANC ) took place in response to the National Assembly of the National Constituent Assembly - a controversial law that has been banned , a controversial law that has &quot; spread &quot; on social media .
If you consider to consider that people have been arrested because of tweets , it seems that this regulation has already been active .
Since 2014 , the current crisis has been facing a large shortage of goods and basic services , such as paper , electricity , and <unk> .
This shortage , in addition to the political method of public policies and news , has caused an isolated and highly controlled situation for communication and spreading information .

I observed today that my computer access to El Alto , La Nación , and other Venezuelan pages that have been &quot; unpleasant &quot; for the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship .
Does others have the problem ?
The investigation can be set for a report .
Months later , journalists on Twitter and other media outlets reported that El Alto is one of the most important newspapers of the country :
This is what El Scale on the server reads :
&quot; It &apos;s not about <unk> , it &apos;s for banning &quot;
Salvacion Público , an organization that defends freedom of expression and access to information , condemned on her Twitter page that through the blocking of Internet service provider , websites of public content like <unk> and <unk> .

The question that needs to be posed here , is how to come .
Everyone would say that Chavism is a regime that Chavism is a regime that seems to be lost in all areas of society .
Those seeking to try to get rid of the way to get a complete rule of society .
Other users quickly started the real scope of the measure and their close connection with Internet censorship - a current concern not only in Venezuela :
In my opinion , the main problem is not only the ban on pornographic pages , which is already a disaster , but that the block will also extend to other sites .
What does they block blocked sites ?
They do the block other pages that will happen suddenly .
However , other users suspect that it does not have any non @-@ censorship or <unk> .
They push broadband internet and the <unk> it for the issue :
The ban on porn sites is neither <unk> nor has been created because the government wants to protect children .
The real reason is that Venezuela has no money to pay the scope of these pages that will provide $ 150 percent of Internet access .
What alternatives are there ?
Maybe Tor can help ... or not
Tor is a free software that is used to browse the web , and it is accessible to access to the Internet , and Tor has been blocked , and Tor has been blocked online .
The blocking of various web users in the Tor network seems to be completely effective , and it &apos;s not entirely effective .
Nevertheless , organizations such as Acceso Libre or Foriegners Sin confirms that Tor was blocked .
They are using solutions to put a end :
We can confirm that Tor ( in direct link ) is @ <unk> , you can use it with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
This post is part of the blocking of blocking @ <unk> in Venezuela .
To circumvent censorship , bridges can use bridges and Tor :
If you look dark and the background , the projection is dark for freedom of expression and access to information .
Many Venezuelans are asking what media or <unk> will be censored next and what can be done to be done to be the measures of the government .

I am a staunch supporter of the war ; it &apos;s far to learn about to learn and help new experiences .
This contention is both responsible for the <unk> and intellectual .
So as a result of a temporary international non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ non @-@ profit organization ( British NGO ) , I packed my suitcase and made me on the way to Europe .
I didn &apos;t go to the big money that was always told us , even if the salary was .
The one who is prepared to be prepared , and about the rare brushes of writing , is what it means to be a institution that is owned by a white majority .
He was raised in Uganda and mainly in the African region of the Big lakes , I didn &apos;t know what it meant .
Although I understood with the rice giant in Africa , as it was also a filmmaker in Africa , the Democratic Republic of Congo , a filmmaker from the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , I had the experience of a minority in his film &quot; <unk> - &quot; I had the experience of a minority .
Since the revelations , Oxfam has been paid in the international non @-@ governmental organization for sex in Haiti , the international NGO of domestic women in the past few months .
Following the trial and a number of other <unk> in international media outlets in international media outlets , Angela Bruce @-@ Sabino has found Angela Joyce @-@ Sabino , the former <unk> <unk> of the former <unk> in Haiti with Oxfam America , with Oxfam America and the most needy responses .
Their article &quot; declares <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &quot; But let alone your black face ) , where they see inclusion and racism in the <unk> , left a deep impression and racism in the environment .
The comments of other black women are also being familiar with the sector &apos;s sector and the social currency that you must bear to survive in order to survive .
I had to provide international organizations to different mediation organisations and knew the needs of the local population to be present .
I &apos;ve already felt very thankful about the cartoons of people who draw the media to the media .
This new opportunity , moreover , offered the chance to explain me in one of the world &apos;s biggest challenges for countries in the world .
But not my education in gender questions , and even my experience during a short period of time , and I could prepare my experience to the scenario .
Later on , I learned that I was a time to have been demanding the diversity of inclusion .
My <unk> is introduced to me with me and sought recognition for a regional African woman in the team .
A few months later , two innovative practitioners from Kenya and South Sudan press service , which had only worked almost male .
One day , our <unk> ran the only African candidate in the classroom , and called for three to three African employees .
Maybe that &apos;s the normal way , with the staff of staff in this organization , the first proof that things would not go smoothly .
We exchanged a big smile with the managers and members of our work .
That was the first time I was in my skin without my skin .
So until this day , no one did not have the energetic speakers of the superiors .
But this example of love racism and <unk> brought me to my door and cry .
I was crying because these African wife escape their mental health and a clear health , she was with a masters of her mental health , and all those who had only to offer a man like this one .
I was crying because I didn &apos;t care about it , my African colleague and I was convinced it was my duty to protect them .
The idea was a common Europeans , who had never been in Africa or the Arab world , but it was known for &quot; very rigorous &quot; to report about the experiences of migrants - and you know that the group had heard most of the migrants : &quot; poor Africans &quot; like I heard from different ways .
For these men , we were utterly deprived of African descent , not people with skills that deserve their job .
To get it this year , there was the most common situation with the only white woman .
It was because all this woman had to take part in the discussion , seriously .
At one point , this woman suggested that I should take part in a particular meeting that I didn &apos;t found that it was a lot of work because of this day in my desk .
In the next 30 minutes , the attorney was able to go into my door and demanded that I was going to go to the meeting and revealed that I didn &apos;t disagree with this woman .
I was surrounded by the White Yuan .
The role that the white woman was in the racist and <unk> of the racist and <unk> .
She was the one who decided to get a contract , like my colleague from Kenya on the hard side .
I can &apos;t mention how many times I received calls for myself and a real strong hail of abuse on me because a only thing was brought to me on the practical day .
And <unk> , if someone from another department of the other department of my efforts .
Vaccination programs were <unk> .
The supervisor expressed his hostility toward women &apos;s hostility towards those who were all knows , and not <unk> remarks about these women .
While most of the most colleagues at the middle of the middle of the diaspora knew that this man had had no opportunity to address the issue .
While the work itself was interesting and I learned to pay a price , I had to pay a price with ignorance , sexism and racism .
After six months , I received a contract with another department , but my refusal demanded that I remained dropped .
The fact that I had had a contract without his creation , pushed him to his worst behaviour .
I shared a office with another white stick to a other white stick to the Paraguayan band , and the boss started calling on me to call me to me and call me with all sorts of replies .
I heard more of others that the plan was to leave me , which was naturally able to think of course .
However , I had a digital system from nothing .
I had managed to build used with employees in <unk> relationships , even though it &apos;s usually at the mention of the presidential calendar .
But all this was not what happened to the superiors until I was not grateful to the superiors .
The evident harassment and tribulations of two colleagues have left her job to leave two colleagues ; a play in a different department and the other was denied a <unk> , because he &apos;s accused of the White Armed Movement .
We tried to report these racism and sexism .
Among the most high @-@ ranking colleagues told us that it would be impossible to do something because &quot; he has good links to the Big Crimes in the War . &quot;
Follow the benefits of
Even a recent human rights activist , told me that it would be a consultant , suggesting that it would be a consultant that would affect the events because I risk a bad effect .
Given all these obstacles and restrictions , I decided to leave a year to leave the organization , rather than a year to get proper care and justice .
But honest , I was depressed .
Women are taking less than 30 percent of the labor workers in a sector where women are the ones who are affected by the victims , and I hope that the discussions about # <unk> is to highlight the extent of racism and abuse in development aid .
The authorities have to find solutions to the inclusion - not only in the sense of people and women in sport , but make sure that there are real rules , <unk> practices and opportunities to prevent such abuses and opportunities .

The jungles of Calais - once US Woman waited for Refugees today · Global Voices
A short , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through a <unk> , wide <unk> with judges and abandoned gardens surrounded by the Germans in the 1940s .
It is about a cup of what you are doing so much of the rich rituals and factories that make the effects of the city generates on a rather <unk> landscape .
Thus , in June 2012 , the Wildlife Wildlife Sanctuary was opened in the city in June 2012 , in June 2012 , where the so @-@ called &quot; jungles of Calais &quot; was living up to 10,000 refugees from Afghanistan , Sudan , Syria , Eritrea , Eritrea and other countries .
Between clashes and a intense media coverage , the refugee camp reached the refugee camps in October 2016 , and they were not only the makeshift facilities , including restaurants , shops , a mosque and a Church , including restaurants , and a church .
The local authorities decided to take this place as a &quot; ecological and ecological effort &quot; to be a &quot; ecological and hygienic unaccomplished , &quot; which is based on the official website , promote the work of a &quot; great flora like <unk> , like <unk> of birds and the presence of birds , for example . &quot;
However , there is speculation that the actual motivation of this project is to remove <unk> people from the city , and not to protect flora and fauna .
There are nothing else as a <unk>
Since the &quot; jungles &quot; was organized since the &quot; jungle &quot; , French authorities set up similar projects in other parts of the world .
This is how it aims to turn another <unk> , a small body of child lives in a park , where the forests will be living in a park , and will be closed to the forests .
The official name of the 2.5 hectares of forest is &quot; hampered , &quot; which residents of the group gave him the &quot; <unk> forest . &quot;
Every day they will provide food , water and water supplies every day .
The dam is located between a freeway , a <unk> and a residential area .
These close to other local communities led to tension in the past , especially in the context of refugees , including the youth of refugees , who help refugees do not receive enough enough for refugees .
Mayor secretary representative published on June 12 , 2018 marked a massive public session in the hall of Calais on Wednesday morning .
Global Voices participated in the gathering .
However , in this forest , the forest was just fifteen minutes ago when another local residents looked like to find a solution to this group .
The city &apos;s plans to see that the park is built in which the park is built in which the forest is built through a fence outside of the country , and the cameras will be treated through using air @-@ driven parks .
According to the Mayor , this is to help the owners of dogs to identify their business in the park .
During the rally , many other suggestions were presented including the construction of <unk> , a <unk> or a <unk> @-@ <unk> .
Meanwhile , toilets or <unk> were not mentioned .
The cost of <unk> will cost to 1.5 million euros .
The time for the project is realised that some elements of major priority are more than others , as the area has already planned since August .
This is how the &quot; jungle of Calais &quot; was made on January 17 , 2016 .

&quot; No <unk> &quot;
The proposed demand of the state @-@ based Forest Forest industry is related to the ongoing <unk> of <unk> in Calais , and we find each daily every day .
In the sense of new strategy , &quot; no <unk> &quot; will be <unk> by authorities , using tear gas or tents , <unk> , <unk> and blankets .
These actions are usually <unk> at night or sit @-@ in at night or sit @-@ in .
They are not only cut out of the refugees , but also their personal possessions of police force , but also their personal possessions of violence against refugees , including the number of cases of violence .
We will never know what happened to the small forest after the small <unk> is named for MyGov .
In 1988 , Brazilian activist in 1988 were dedicated to the struggle for the preservation of the Amazon forest , and for the rights of a non @-@ profit farmers .
With the words of Michel Monteiro , the director of the French Research Research Institute ( Institute ) , and author of the book &quot; La bruja de Calais &quot; ( &quot; German &quot; ) and author of the book &quot; La soledad de Calais &quot; has only an attempt to be an attempt that would only be an attempt to &quot; eliminate a city &quot; in the past :
Many of the political crises currently lead to many of the political crises .
The inhabitants of Calais are outraged that they are very bad in these people , and the bad picture of the city is so bad .
It is not really about the camp or the migrants , but rather it is not a solution to the plight of these people .

When the soldier was identified as a <unk> cartoonist , suggesting that he will not reach his goal , he fired her in the park , she has suffered serious injuries .
A few time later , she was given to care for her treatment , however , that their skills had not been allowed to provide medical care for the lack of health care .

Even though you have recently tried to do in certain regions of Somalia , anti @-@ slavery laws , a massive climate change in the state of impunity to carry out their actions with impunity with impunity .
Rape rape in the camps · Global Voices
More than two decades of civil war and famine forced many people to leave their home and live in camps for people .
Women and girls outside in camps outside the major cities are often affected by sexual assault .
They are vulnerable , and most rape are used in the middle of the night or when they used to gather remote locations .
At the same time , victims of the warehouse have often not given a legal job , a legal counsel that would be necessary to make them necessary for justice .
Rohan , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ year @-@ old mother and resident of Opium Mission , was raped on the eyes of her children .
In an interview with Global Voices ( GV ) described the attack :
It was midnight when an armed man in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in my <unk> ran away , chased by the outdoors .
He didn &apos;t only raped me , but I was doing a deep wound on my body to my body , which is still a lot of pain today .
At the night of the train station , men from police officers arrived in the semi @-@ IDP camp at the night of the town of Magpet .
The men <unk> into tents and broken shelling and other mother disappeared .
Both women were raped and must continue to wait for justice for their deteriorating injuries .
But the attackers arrested , but they were not accused from a court not before a court .
According to the Human Right Human Right Defenders in the region , an independent media magazine in the southern African region of 2017 , 80 rape cases in South African countries .
However , the real number of rape is higher in spite higher , because many victims have no longer rallied - from fear of stigma , <unk> trust in the capital and university authorities .
Aside from the issue of prosecution , the public health system and lack of public equipment and medical equipment that needed to be required for the sector , which needs another obstacle for documenting sexual assault .
Health services are also unable to deal with rape cases .
The indigenous culture can also be able to accept justice because of a regional practice that victims are marrying their attackers or &quot; Camels &quot; as compensation for the attack :
Rape are present and remain in faster than a decade in many of the refugees , because there has been a climate of violence and institutions that should be restored in the law .
The tradition states that rape victims - often camels or livestock - accept their attacker , and their attacker on the ground as part of a ceremonial trend that claimed the war between rival tribes .
Little steps in the right direction - but is it enough ?
On September 9 , 2017 , the main region of cooperation with the first significant survey of the first rapid laboratories , which is related to rape cases in <unk> .
A year ago , in September 2016 , the first notable region of Somalia , which passed a anti @-@ government law , has been granted full support to the bill by issuing its full support to the bill , which was later officially approved by a law .
On January 6 , 2018 , the country &apos;s parliament , in favor of the region &apos;s parliament , has also marked the role of a new anti @-@ government bill .
However , it will continue to take place until this bill was passed from the elders , the elders decided to be decided to be passed .
Although the issue of the Somali government , sexual violence and the international community has been widespread , sexual violence against women and children are widespread in recent years .

On June 13 , the lawmakers of the deputy Student Assembly of University of Congress voted on a bill on June 13 .
Officially , the debate has begun in March - a historic milestone in the long struggle for fundamental rights in Argentina .
During the weekend two months , both charges were both rebuked for both charges .
In the case of the debate , the law has been adapted to suit the votes of the votes .
Among the most important changes is the opportunity to Doctors who hold the flow of <unk> from <unk> , but hospitals are required to contribute to the intervention .
In addition , women from 16 years need the approval of their parents or their <unk> .
Meanwhile , online and offline .
Their message reads &quot; <unk> to have a choice ; <unk> to avoid abortion , &quot; legal abortions to avoid deaths . &quot;
At the same time , several religious organizations have been carrying the &quot; relatives rescue &quot; against the law .
For June 13 , a vigil was planned before the Congress of Congress , while legislators arrive in the House of Representatives .
Various surveys show that large parts of the population is supporting the law .
Even renowned journalist Eduardo Muizzu , a freelance journalist , tweeted a short survey on Twitter , but was not pleased with the results :
&quot; poll : Are you for or legal , safe and free abortion ? . &quot;
However , the analysis of the Ministers of Ministers of Ministers , however , shows a great majority of the proposals against legalizing .
In many cases , however , even though the legislators will not be heard , either because the legislators don &apos;t have to punish themselves or because they are afraid of fear from pressure or threats .
The last day of the official debate was made by a powerful speech at the edges of a state of student student Adolfo abamako.com :
We have been living in a democracy since 35 years .
Abortion is a topic that will be under the French .
The evidence are clearly : a crashing leads to less Rice and less abortion .
How to act in any way .
If the draft of the law will be adopted , it will effectively put the Senate , where there is a huge majority of fighting against legalizing .
But this trend could change , however , as the result of the debate in terms of the country &apos;s house , where members of the members were taking a crucial role .
&quot; I &apos;m just one of many women with a green scarf who looks at the Congress &quot;
It is impossible to view the influence of public opinion in the polls but also in various personal stories that are widely shared online .
In one of them , a woman focuses on the legal and deep obstacles that they faced herself when they faced a minimum of abortion .
She mentions the name of doctors not in public , but she describes how some refused to help her , and how a doctor wanted to provide money for the operation :
My head and body didn &apos;t recover .
I felt the same fear as I am going to talk about the help and health care of medical sector and the doctors I needed to do the leap .
When I was sleeping , I spent each time ago , Dr. Kality and Dr. Rowley I have to think about Dr B. arguing about him in Congress as he saw his life .
She concludes :
I feel that I have great difficulties in the past few days .
I have a couple friends who <unk> me as if I &apos;m looking for my hand , including this day I am one of many women with a green scarf looking at the Congress and ask him for settling marijuana .
On Twitter , users have commented on the issue and critical opinions of the bill :
The UN has defined the criminalization of abortion as a <unk> .
If the draft bill won &apos;t be adopted , all parliamentarians who voted against these torture and the potential deaths .
They will become every single woman who have conscience .
Abortion is being held , either legal or illegal .
&quot; I &apos;m just in rape for legal abortion if not , then they &apos;re the fact that she would have done the legs , &quot; she says , &quot; both lives &quot; would not punish women , right only women ?
Targeted or illegal abortion , this is the question .
In Latin America , Argentina would be the second country in Latin America to legalize the global trend or sensitivity for the decriminalization .
The first country in the region , which made this step , was Uruguay 2012 .
It was the reason why he was struck by the police in Latin America .
Let &apos;s become the country we want .
A country without corruption that is a <unk> of self @-@ economy , with a <unk> self @-@ economy , social dialogue , and legal abortion .

Even if you do not be tortured , it is torture enough .
Have they forget about ?
Are we the rest of our life here ?
Why are we not going unnoticed today ?
Have they discovered the phone ?
Questions about questions about the head .
The day goes on .
Every days , the smell to blood and <unk> , which <unk> you around you all .
You &apos;ll give you all the bodies of the other detainees to the bodies of the other detainees and the silver walls .
How mistaken it is like it .
As usual as usual , the fifth day .
The guards opens the door and call : &quot; Sarmad , <unk> ! &quot; I leave the cell and <unk> me the poor face my heads to my head and handcuffed .
I am going to cross the <unk> to a space that was similar in my head .
&quot; On the knees ! &quot; I was blocking the order to shut down .
The <unk> conversation will be accompanied by a gold camera on paper , and another person is now on paper .
You really see <unk> , <unk> older than your age , and if you are actually a doctor of doctors , you can only get out of good home .
Why just <unk> you a gun with you ? &quot;
He starts with a lawsuit filed against domestic weapons in the announcement that I &apos;d at least try to attend demonstrations in demonstrations .
I never had one , and I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , &quot; a distance of us and I went through the body .
Honestly , if a third person , standing on me and chased his knees . &quot;
The <unk> continues : &quot; Listen , <unk> , you really cannot tell us anything .
We even apply tea .
I want you to believe you don &apos;t think you &apos;re a weapon of you .
But , you do you know that you will have <unk> the demonstrations , we will be completely uncomfortable , &quot; but I &apos;ve done it . &quot; But I &apos;ve done it . &quot;
&quot; In order , <unk> , then we hear together , &quot; he plays a video where I &apos;m watching a demonstration in a demonstration , &quot; Are you listening ?
We treat no of them .
This is your voice , and this video was taken by Al Squad , &quot; a thought terrified in my head : you always say Al Muslimi &apos;s story .
Then it can only be <unk> .
His last sentence marks the end of the oral .
Now he starts to speak the only language he understands , and <unk> <unk> on me , with just a few short profile .
Until he &apos;s intended to serve an hour , I guess I guess .
Let &apos;s return to my cell back .
A sum is needed to let me go .
Since the first hearing , I feel as a state of conscience , as a state of conscience , in his position .
With <unk> and <unk> , we beat the same way , the same direction is the same direction .
The same old voices <unk> from the walls .
I &apos;m fed up , my breath , my breath , because I don &apos;t stop anything . &quot; If you can &apos;t stop the Krach , then better to breathe !
Or you want to make sure I swear ? &quot; must be busy .
I am going to take a closer look at how I can only get .
I &apos;m shaking with fear or cold cold ?
Ah <unk> , what do my teeth don &apos;t listen to my teeth . &quot; So well , <unk> , why don &apos;t you just make it , you do not make a end ?
Then I finally can go home and release you to go home .
Who filming you ?
How did you manage to get away from the TV group ?
Is there something that we don &apos;t know ?
I mean , we know everything , but I would like to hear from your mouth . &quot;
No time to think ; ever , the fewer doubts , the fewer doubts , the fewer doubts .
I would have all <unk> and say I can &apos;t have done anything .
I think they are doing it well , &quot; he &apos;ll be able to get the eyes freely , &quot; he soon <unk> my eyes .
I am sure ; I have to agree with you you can see again .
Listen to me , Sarmad , you are still young and your whole future before you .
We can all hold all the doors of the nose , we can open thousands of doors .
The decision is coming to you and join this mobile phone here ; <unk> you on Facebook or in this Yahoo video , or you are telling your videos , and tell me that it will be going to be <unk> and tell me that we can be <unk> here . &quot;
In such a moment , you &apos;re looking for each single sentence of the head for the other prisoners who told her <unk> .
The value of your life is closely with people around you .
You <unk> to raise $ 0 - who will be allowed to stand in danger and who will be sacrificed if there is no other place ?
My mother often spoke of &quot; <unk> , &quot; which you don &apos;t even wish to make his <unk> enemy , and I would really wish it to be my neck .
&quot; I use my e @-@ mail account only for ordinary people .
From , please be log , I log , &quot; after several <unk> on my neck , I have used the wrong secret ( I have used a false account ) , <unk> for such situations .
Creative web websites , online and dozens online forums .
Is it sure .
It is not very clear about what &apos; <unk> &apos; means what ?
No problem . &quot;
He summarized the eyes of me , changing his belongings from the table and leaves the room .
A few minutes later , without any man who <unk> my <unk> , no panacea me my life .
Then the door went . &quot; On the knees ! &quot; The voice is different .
He <unk> me in a person and listen to me .
Just go beyond my feet .
The screams break out of me .
He continues to go out of his gentle cold water to me to me a <unk> cold water .
This is how hours continued for hours , I can hear how to <unk> a drink that he has fever .
It is also possible to the cigarettes ; it &apos;s in the room where we are not permitted to do that hours , he denies the premises on my back .
I am weary , and he runs - among ourselves , because I can keep my help at their legs .
After several attempts to succeed in my cell .
I <unk> immediately in Baghdad.news .
This is only one of the key system of a <unk> system where the thinking is about the crime and the mistreatment of the criminals who were arrested in prison .
It is a system that seeks to define the illusion of freedom - one of the dictatorship &apos;s dictatorship , because she exposes the truth .
Sarmad , you don &apos;t sleep all day , you have to stand up and bring you to pick up Abdel Rahman .
Apparently I didn &apos;t have a brief moment in which the seat was asked for the next day , as usual as the next day , &quot; either they will be calm , or they make you free .
Like all other people , &quot; he says with a smile .
Abdel Rahman , a young man from <unk> , is one of the few intellectuals here .
His smile never leaves his face when he is talking to the other .
In the time , he worked in the lobby room in Volgodonsk , and he received many books .
At a police group , several banned books were found on him - and some pictures that he was seen as a protester .
A time enough to arrest him .
A few new prisoners come from the day .
All of them talk from a certain impression that was thrown in a hole near our police .
And then he &apos;s left the <unk> with a knife , and it &apos;s more difficult , &quot; one of the <unk> , &quot; says one of the <unk> , <unk> .
He continues : &quot; He is big and strong , he was growing . &quot;
Another few hours , according to permission .
We <unk> all over the door to look at the door , a <unk> , white man , <unk> young man , he sits in his legs in his legs for his legs , to see the bullet destroyed the bullet destroyed by the bullet destroyed and his throat is a <unk> .
The guards are afraid of him !
They dropped it out .
We &apos;re fed up in grave silence , hoping to hear everything that it was hard to hear .
Nothing !
We live out of our routine , <unk> fate .
They &apos;ve brought him into the military department .
Time passes without any word .
In the wake of each other , back to their previous training , do you do nothing to do anything else , even if there &apos;s nothing to do with a lot of sit @-@ up and time ?
The door on the <unk> is <unk> .
Its steps come closer .
Our cell will open and put down .
Then the door continues .
We wait until the guards continue to be moved and wash wounds .
If we were dogs in these distant countries , we &apos;ve already gone around again and would be <unk> , so even protected .
But here as a human being you &apos;re until you &apos;re in the series ; either you <unk> for her wounds or her .
This is an hour , since it &apos;s already increased in consciousness , and after a few minutes .
Then he drove his hand to the <unk> !
This is more than a window to a grave ; only the guards and its ability to use him .
None of us had so far warmed up .
&quot; Hey , you !
I was just a pretty smart young man , and a lot of women in the nose .
Can it be your sister under them ?
Are you so evil on me ?
Or do I guess the ass and you have been back in my blood since my blood ?
If you were told , we &apos;d just have a peaceful peacefully .
It &apos;s not a reason for all these anger . &quot;
Lovely <unk> and laughs .
I was able to hear the hearts of the others from their respective peers - and I also was pretty sure that I was pretty sure , and we only live with God .
We knew that we could die .
Then we drove them before at least a <unk> .
Or do you think that these killers kill us to kill other people because we are afraid of ?
holder - they have much more afraid of us than we . &quot;
He deliberately speaks that the guards can hear us .
Three of them beat the door and dance in the cell rooms .
They beat them on fire and run him outside .
It should be the last time I see myself in the military camp in Deir bowls .
In the field of weather and human rights abuses in their country , the shooting of a unarmed youths is being seen by a unarmed teenager by the shooting of an unarmed teenager .
The image makes the killing of thousands of people , including youth .

This year , which was passed in January this year , in January this year , will be used to use illegal activities in the cultural sector , including selling books from the cultural sector .
The controversial regulations have challenged guidelines within cultural sector and demand that those who are capable of communicating with the artistic services to the official institutions .
Furthermore , penalties targeting the demands of the demands of the demands are the right to make it stolen .
Besides the decree imposed by imposing fines , using the application of tools , computer and other <unk> that were used for the activities of the activity .
The original event is also intended to end .
The controversial nature of the norm itself has also been referring to a review of the article , which acts &quot; the dignity of people &quot; acts .
This is an unprecedented exception to exploitation or sexual orientation , as well as violent images of crimes , which would be a complete exception in the state of Cuba .
Many of the creators of the decree serve as a result of the creation of the decree , and that these controls control the scope of the artistic news .
One of the most fundamental arguments is that this <unk> of the independent artist woke up the possibilities of the independent artist , and the door would open for policy policy and laws that are <unk> .
The event to charge the event &apos;s case with discussions about a new constitution for the country &apos;s new constitution .
But many believe that the discussions of the anti @-@ decree protests against the decree .
In the midst of the discussion , a group of intellectuals , artists and activists have launched a campaign against the decree &apos;s Facebook page , which includes the support of the Gambia &apos;s Special Rapporteur on Facebook page .

The campaign is trying to collect 10,000 signatures ; this is the Cuban Constitution worth a figure to reach a legal norm .
Meanwhile , a petition and open letter to the petition were shared on Avaaz to take advantage of the norm in the norm .
In the text , their concerns describe the art and culture in Cuba over the coming years when legal authorities decide to charge who is permission to maintain who is permission , partner activities and who should fund them :
Today , a crowdfunding crowdfunding team provides a crowd of support for artistic projects .
The fact that an intellectual artist is involved in the situation , not to raise awareness of their own resources - millions of people use new technologies to spread their works on the edge of mass media .
There are also also a challenge to question the risks of being posed with murky legal criteria within the decree , such as the punishment of &quot; <unk> content to counter filtering and cultural values . &quot;
The open letter is based on President Cuba &apos;s president , Miguel Díaz Díaz , and was signed by artists and intellectuals , and was signed by artists and intellectuals such as Eg @-@ language , evangelical <unk> , Coco Financing and Enrique del Montaña .
The concerns of the release of the letter will be shared by the organization Lidia Ucher .
Independent artist or those who have not connected with state institutions or groups of civil society , have seen doubly discrimination , due to what the way of expression and means of expression is as a protest .
Additionally , questions came into the favour of this norm in religious domains , where artistic activities take place .
This is known in the <unk> de <unk> ( also known as PM10 ) , a popular religion religion in Cuba , both dance and music of rituals .
At the same time , a hip @-@ hop song , which shows artists like David D &apos; <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , directed by artists like David D &quot; <unk> &quot; and the band &quot; Niñas para Manga &quot; was produced by the band &quot; Kombinatsia para Ricardo . &quot;
Your censorship shows the closing of concerts that you <unk> .
They &apos;ve always been able to thought her .
You push us to enjoy art , ignorance
What were you doing as you in the constitution against artists ?
In the wake of the growing oppression .

A study conducted by the Institute of Social and Public Prosecution ( SGP ) , which appeared in collaboration with the foundation &quot; Clean Civil Organization , &quot; published on May 22 , shows that it has been a group of a group that highlights their origins on May 22 that they had their goals rather than the Islamic Islamic Empire themselves , and their goals are more than Islamic Islamic .
Between November 2017 and February 11 , 2018 , Israel overthrew three trips to Faisal suspected , among other religious leaders and families of youth who are part of local groups and authorities .
The investigation also suggests that the group was originally known as a Particularly chunk of the group , a Arabic term , which means &quot; supporters of the most rigorous tradition and judiciary , &quot; which means that the group is calling for in the local communities .
From 2015 the movement began to integrate military cells .
According to the study , members of the country &apos;s members of Mozambique ( ISAMA ) were trained by former police officers ( KTB ) , and the service of the service , and by militia from Tanzania and other countries in the region around the world .
The group is playing down from socially marginalized , without formal education and without legal education .
Although they had religious roots and propaganda accross the restoration of the alleged traditional values of Islam , she had not been the occupation of Alaa suspected , or the establishment of the Islamic state in the north of the country .
This assumption is confirmed by the police by police activists .
People were able to integrate themselves in the group after they promised to be promised after the disasters .
The study also shows that the goal is to ensure illegal investment services in the region , including trade production , timber runoff and timber timber .
The investigator stated that in the context of the law , illegally 50,000 appeals to the government , which means the state of 3 million US dollars in the same time .
The beginning of the &quot; Operation Defensive Edge &quot; by the government in 2017 , which has been threatened by the government &apos;s illegal force , has been threatened and may have contributed to the turmoil .
It is also believed that a part of the insurgents from arthropod Province , located in southern Province , located in the southern province of Qassim , located in the southern Province of the city of Qassim , where they received the radioactive spill in 2012 .
In February 2017 , the government ordered the security forces to all the illegal ones who stayed in the area .
At the time , we have been reported about torture by the military in the local press , which led to a criminal investigation that has yet to reach .
The majority of the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> is a society that represents the 75 % of the country &apos;s country , and the Mozambican state leaders , who have ruled the country since independence in 1975 , a political party that has ruled the country since independence .

The authors of the study will be the recruitment of the community in coordination with social conditions , as unemployment and lack of basic social institutions , including the economic conditions of education and health services .

Global Voices ( GV ) : Why should People think in your opinion in Cuba for the opportunity to legalize their relationship ?
Harmany <unk> ( <unk> ) : I think that this should be a legal means for the legal means .
Most importantly , because many legal procedures are related to the creation of the philanthropic intellectual property , to ensure that the relationship between intellectual property and the law is recognized .
As such as this means , marriage is marriage for all , pensions or something else , it will depend on what our revolutionists are capable of overcome and overcome our ability to overcome us .
On international level , there are several countries where their justice system is committed .
In Cuba , we have hardly done the first step .
I personally don &apos;t believe that a legal relationship with emotional stability is the emotional stability of a relationship , but it can help protect the heritage of palm and religion .
The reason for the extent of legal law , right @-@ wing couples to adoption .
It &apos;s a topic that just few people speak in Cuba .
It is complicated and not free of voices .
GV : Do you think a national referendum will be necessary to determine whether long @-@ sex partnerships between people in Cuba should be allowed to be allowed ?
bismAskari : I personally believe that the right of the people of the people should not be subject to the same issue , not even the majority .
However , there are some legal things that cannot be ignored .
For instance , the marriage will defines marriage in the Cuban constitution ( Article 36 ) as &quot; voluntary <unk> of a man and a woman , who have legally existed to get married to live . &quot;
The main concern of <unk> populations .
Some important adjustments could be found here beyond recognition of recognition , recognised communities , which is not the requirement for a formal marriage system , everything without a formal marriage .
This second option seems to be the <unk> , but it seems only a limited reach .
If they are supposed to have the laws , marriage is still a universal right / privilege for marriage and sex marriage , with a high @-@ older community that would be satisfied with a retired community .
But I am supposed to assume that a state degree between people in the same gender is just a matter of sexual diversity .
It &apos;s why I think I should think about the point of any legal initiative and the agenda generated by activists and organizations .
In terms of marriage , <unk> said :
I think it &apos;s gone .
With the story of the story , marriage is a tool of extending marriage , <unk> and the Jewish Christian @-@ Christian standards .
I <unk> the decision of all those who want to give a chance , but I think the debate has not reached the most comprehensive ones that they should have .
That &apos;s why I &apos;d like to throw questions about future debates in the room :
Why is the spirit of marriage in so many headlines ?
What was she summed up in the agenda of sexual diversity ?
Does there be sense to fight marriage only because they have the right ?
What is the real <unk> of the legal means ?
If we talk about recognition of marriage , this only has the relationship between two people ?
What is going on with the relationship ?
Should their own point be left at the time ?
What will change marriage for trans people change for medical supplies and <unk> priority ?
Will the marriage change for a lesbian woman who support the total support for reproduction in Cuba ?
Because the department of the Ministry of Health was conceived , it is not enough to be sufficient couples to be linked to marriage because it is a part of the couple .
GV : Can you know a case or a state of emergency in Cuba in the people who have not been recognized in the familiar region ?
ol : I know many cases .
One of them is a friend who was criticized for the death of his partner and was criticized by her intellectual property .
It &apos;s a great story .
Years earlier , the father of the deceased brought him from the house .
After his death , the father was almost all delayed his son .
Since the community was legal , it was well known as no legal status .
In addition , there are many ( restaurants , hotels and other places ) services , and non @-@ couples are not allowed for couples to remain same @-@ sex couples .
GV : Before four years ago , a commenter published by the newspaper Nacional Hernández Hernández ( Administration of the Communist Party ) , titled &quot; Marriage for All knowledge , &quot; notes : &quot; Marriage for All the society , is equally <unk> to the recognition of revoking people and animals , as it is the recognition of displacement between people and animals .
It should not be legal because it is not normal .
There are couples who spend all their entire lives , without married to legalizing something that is not normal ? &quot;
How would you answer such a way ?
Rykov : For all , I would like to show that the comment on you was inspired by a post that is motivated by a post on May 6 , 2014 .
In post @-@ article posts published in recent articles , the journalist writes about the United Nations Secretary @-@ Secretary @-@ Secretary @-@ Secretary of International Lesbian , Gay @-@ e @-@ Secretary of the International Lesbian Association ( CPPCC ) .
Guadalupe &apos;s comment reflects the personal opinion of someone who is open to sex marriage .
It &apos;s his opinion , and I respect her great ignorance about the issue is clear .
The concept of &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course &quot; is so long as the <unk> itself is .
What is a normal and natural course , it &apos;s not the other and of course .
It has been a long time since the day of history .
During the times of slavery , the purchase of a person has become a &quot; normal &quot; and &quot; of course , &quot; something of what today is <unk> .
If there is one thing I &apos;m completely convinced that the love we are capable of religious people , we are legitimate , as legitimate is the love of love people .

The next 48 hours is crucial for democracy in Guatemala .
The Constitutional Court has called for the government in a recent verdict to the country , which was the director of Colombian lawyers demanding the return to his work as director of the United Nations supported International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala ( Anda , <unk> <unk> la <unk> en Guatemala ) .
Last month , Guatemala &apos;s president Jimmy Morales announced the mandate of the <unk> committee in the United States , which is located in the United States which is in the United States who is returning to Guatemala .
The decision triggered both national and international outrage and led to violent condemnation and protests .
Earlier , the Commission of Morales and members of his family has been accused of an illegal anti @-@ torture campaign , and Morales , which <unk> the <unk> of illegal housing , and his subscribers has now made a result of the Constitutional Court .
The next two days are not only a test for the democratic institutions in Guatemala , but also for the sectors that have supported the president in the past .
According to a official survey , Morales could lead Morales to approve the President &apos;s decision to justify legal action against the president of the president .
Journalists like Nina explored the current situation and other commenters on social media events , especially if they refuse to refuse to pay out to the court order , and the army would sign for support :
Guatemala : The ruling of the Constitutional Court &apos;s Decision is concluded .
The constitution is seen in the terms of the constitution , it is not possible to ignore the @ <unk> against President @ <unk> , or publish .
What will he be done and the country &apos;s network will be next ?
The constitution determines or <unk> will be = fee ?
Human rights activists , including family members , have reacted with relief and belongings , but also with concerns about the government &apos;s next steps and the Congress :
Print news of Guatemala &apos;s justice system .
Welcome to <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala .
It had to come .
The <unk> Constitutional Court has made the public order again .
What could happen next 48 hours when <unk> <unk> to Guatemala ?
A political deja vu ?
In light of the long and difficult struggle against corruption and political turmoil in the past few months in Guatemala , these events have a very special meaning .
As the political rise of Morales , the political rise of Morales against corruption and impunity , which had created large swathes of political class and then the resignation of then President Otto Pérez Molina .
In the 2015 political crisis , the commission &apos;s investigation and its investigation was expected to be an important impact on the government &apos;s government .
Now where Morales themselves is in political scandals and corruption , the current crisis is considered an important moment in Guatemala for its protection of protection from its democratic institutions or even a huge step for its own .
Salvadoran journalist Héctor Silva points out the attitude between Morales &apos; <unk> and Morales &apos; s President .
Jimmy Morales took to the presidency in Guatemala with support of the group , including some of the connections with military service .
When he took office , he said he was neither a corrupt or corrupt .
Today he is a president to prevent a president from <unk> power to prevent corruption against him .
Meanwhile , the hashtag # <unk> ( &quot; Well now &quot; ) , which was used during the protests in 2015 , was launched again during the protests of 2015 .
At the same time , international media outlets have stressed the importance of the crisis in Guatemala as the Colombian newspaper El Universo , and called the international community to track further developments in the country :
Whatever any changes , the situation is the tension caused by the tension in this country and that <unk> a sore point hit , no one is trying to deal with the issue without a great investigation .
This is why the international community needs to protect the people of Guatemala &apos;s institutions and search for the truth .
The eyes of the world should be to be on the brink of the world in its <unk> , and the results could have a great impact on the story of a whole elite that is similar .

In the hills of the northern <unk> of India in western India , the community of culture is a peaceful and hard life .
From the hills , the Echo of songs gathered for each activity for any activities .
They are not a average of high villagers that live in the same place and have a funds cut off .
The bodies are more nomadic , like their name best - &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; is translated to &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; .
During the last generations , however , the bulk of a training ship that could be lost in <unk> : the inconceivable of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in Sikkim saw many challenges , such as climate change , such as climate change , economic insecurity and health care in a town .
These challenges have increased as the Macedonian borders in the 1960s , these challenges have increased .
One of the world &apos;s lives is a long @-@ fetched battle , with the outcome that the number of people who are willing to take the traditional lives of the people who are willing to take to the traditional lives .
In 1962 , a year ago marked each year in Tibet , where she was originally visited the north of Sikkim in the northern areas of Sikkim to <unk> her <unk> .
During the <unk> room , she has temporarily been running near areas of bats in Tibet near the grass level and <unk> , and not through the weight of snow .
In the summer , they marched south in the northern region of the northern desert and left some time in areas like angelcaido , animaldeciudad , <unk> and laughter .
There was also a herd of the laughter from the laughter of the graffiti Valley , which is not only economic , but also culturally officers for both sides .
The trade worked for cultural exchange and <unk> the peaceful women of the two communities .
In exchange , <unk> around the livestock of the tiger and donkeys , left for the cattle , left after she had their own , packed with cardamom , <unk> , and the livestock .
This exchange has been relief by the agreement between Tibet and India , as well as the open borders that allow the dual self @-@ sufficiency .
Following the occupation of China &apos;s occupation , the border closed down and the military bases were forced to tackle the two sides .
Since then , their cultures have been limited to a region , both in winter and summer .
Dr. Anna Sisombat , the brainchild of the Copa Institute for Gusano Affairs ( Phadet Institute of Globalization ) in <unk> , says that the government &apos;s claim that there was a more 1000 claim that there was a brand of 1,000 replies in front of the world &apos;s success in the world .
Currently , there are fewer than 12 families who lead the traditional lives of the equation .
Other members of the community have found other jobs , and most have tried to tackle small or larger towns .

Despite the odds for
The traditional way of life of life is not easy .
The ban on their cultures in the state of Sikkim is located in winter , they are experiencing heavy snowfall in the cold temperature in the northern areas of foothills in northern parts of the world .
&quot; If it is <unk> , it is very difficult to see both the animals like us , &quot; explained Joanne Gitau , a film of the Yugoslav Institute of Culture titled &quot; Santandano <unk> at the border with North @-@ Sikkim . &quot;
The <unk> are in the <unk> of <unk> on <unk> , but heat is becoming increasingly a problem .
According to <unk> data , the average temperature in <unk> stands at 2.5 degrees .
This has led to a <unk> of emergency prices , and the heat is preparing for the preparation of the world .
The <unk> animals will be able to find a exposure to the exposure to sell them either or sell them , as the grass in winter is covered with snow .
This means an additional edition to buy the <unk> .
For the traditional community , this is relatively new , but it &apos;s relatively important for the promotion of goods of their daily demand and stock .
Since the conflict , the community has to leave the army , even if the army needs to be available in the difficult region , even if the army needs no aid .
In such cases , this is the simple survival of survival .
To understand the <unk> , you need to understand that the <unk> is a central role in life of the community , and they &apos;re staring in and milk and milk and milk , which is like <unk> , as <unk> , as <unk> <unk> .
From crossroad , things like motivational , clothing and <unk> .
In the past few times , expensive <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from wool district , used mostly in Tibet and as a <unk> .
Due to the lack of trade , most of the trade has been suspended .
The milk milk milk in winter is mainly known for tea - in the field of Chai , and in the summer of summer .
Once their legal objection was actually sold in places , one of the cities where he has been rare , according to a business in Qalat .
In addition to all these years , people still become as guests and not as the residents of the area .
By the <unk> , they have to move out and have to move beyond their habits , but also because their habits could be able to toe the rules and regulations of the competing communities .
An uncertain future for the profession of <unk>
However , and despite all of these resistance , others make it a small living for a living .
They <unk> the gaps in the midst of the population that they deem beyond the herds of Sikkim valley and <unk> for the army .
In addition to <unk> , clothes , food , food , food and other <unk> , many are now struggling to wear the cost of their children for their children when they decided to have their children on schools in cities .
After their education and urban life , the children are being used to return to their training , <unk> lifestyle , and , &quot; If everything else , life is the life of the last path , &quot; says Anna Schetnikova <unk> .
Young men also stood back in front of a prison because she would not be able to find a bride that would not be accepted .
Those who love the profession of the profession , mostly posts in the army , the government , or other urban activities .
With recent rising rise in tourism in the sector , <unk> are also subject to the sector .
Those who don &apos;t find any jobs as the last way in the Tibetan Yugoslavia
Neither the government does not support the interest of some non @-@ <unk> organizations to the young people , to be sufficient for young people to continue the traditional life of the hunger striking life .
In spite of all this , those who engage in the traditional citizenship and life of rocket diplomas to Sikkim &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
But even they are aware of the conditions that their children could choose to sell the livestock to sell livestock and cast other jobs .
This is a generation that could easily be the last chapter in the story of a <unk> in Sikkim &apos;s history .
