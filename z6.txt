Of course, the results of the negotiations that have been reached so far should not be lost.
Important steps have been taken to respond to the dangers associated with <unk> and dangerous products.
New procedures have been incorporated into <unk> in order to guarantee protection and security.
The modernised Community Customs Code published today and the decision on electronic customs duties published in January represents important milestones on the road to a <unk> but dynamic contribution to the protection of European citizens and the competitiveness of our economy by facilitating serious health risks.
They are examples of fruitful cooperation between the institutions.
The report rightly emphasises the need for further harmonisation and uniform implementation of the <unk> and the improvement of the organisation and operation of our customs administrations.
I believe that further harmonisation of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved through the following <unk> the current efforts to implement the modernised <unk> programme and the <unk> a new programme for targeted monitoring of the correct and uniform application of the rules of origin and - in partnership with the Member States - assessment of the needs and possibilities of <unk> and <unk>
The Action Programme for the <unk> in the Community <unk> <unk> is also an important tool in this respect.
Finally, I would like to refer to the points contained in the report on the United States' initiative to <unk> all containers with the US from 2012.
The Commission uses all available channels to make it clear to the American authorities that they have taken the wrong route to secure the supply chain.
In April, the Commission presented a substantive report to the US Government with the support of the Member States and the negative impact of this measure on European ports, international trade and maritime transport.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Madam President, I welcome the own-initiative report by my colleague Jean-Pierre <unk> which highlights the importance of the strict application of customs procedures for the smooth functioning of the internal market.
It is unfortunate that we are becoming increasingly <unk> by illegal imports of goods from third countries.
This is not just about <unk> counterfeiting and the circumvention of <unk> our market will also be exempt from goods that do not meet European safety requirements, even though they are often labelled.
Unfortunately, the customs authorities are not available enough for adequate border controls.
Our committee has seen in Antwerp that only 0.5% of all containers per day are controlled every day.
All the <unk> that have confidence in the internal market and damage consumers as well as European producers, who cannot keep in unfair competition with unfair competition.
Although our customs union is now about 40 years, the Member States still do not have sufficient <unk> <unk>
For example, there are significant differences in the rules on <unk> the value and sale of goods or goods.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that greater harmonisation would lead to an improvement in the situation.
The Commission should also respond to the justified objections relating to the uniform application of the criterion of added value, for example from the textile industry.
A too strict and complex management system makes it more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to access international trade.
European competitiveness would undoubtedly make use of the simplification, modernisation and harmonisation of the rules and procedures applicable to the import and export of goods.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Audy on his excellent report on the quality of the report, both in terms of the ideas contained in it and on the proposals put forward.
In fact, as the report explicitly states, it is now an instrument with many <unk>
It has a tax function, which is its original role, but also economic functions and increasingly security policy functions by contributing to the protection of European companies and European consumers.
With regard to the economic aspect, it is of course intended to facilitate international trade and the European Union has every interest in ensuring that this happens.
But it must also focus on its <unk> - security in the interests of <unk> and piracy, the fight against unfair competition, the fight against unfair competition, which is based on a number of European companies, particularly in weaker sectors in the interests of protecting the environment and public health, both goods which our society increasingly appreciate.
That is why we need to make greater progress.
We consider the rapporteur's proposal to be a good one, as it is aimed at promoting the harmonisation of the VAT system.
There is a common trade policy and a common foreign policy, but there are also a number of national administrations which do not always cooperate in the best way.
In order to safeguard the interests of European producers and consumers, more rapid progress towards harmonisation would be desirable.
Progress by means of new forms of coordination through better coordination and the creation of the conditions for effective harmonisation of customs procedures at Community level.
That is why we will give the citizens of Europe a good service, whether from the point of view of producers or from the point of view of consumers.
There is a question which seems to me to be very important and which concerns small and medium-sized enterprises and has also been mentioned in the report and by the previous speaker.
Our small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable to unfair competition, and our <unk> is not always capable of successfully <unk> these risks.
We must therefore invest heavily in this area and improve coordination with small and medium-sized enterprises.
They do not always have an in-depth knowledge of the rules and procedures and are therefore disadvantaged in access to international trade.
I have started as I began, by congratulating the author of this report, which I believe has proved Europe in this specific and very important area of customs policy.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I rise in this debate on behalf of the UEN Group and I would like to address the following three points.
The first is that many countries, including those who are members of the WTO, are not complying with social and environmental standards, but they are also preventing fair competition.
The improvement of access to the European market for goods from such countries must be taken into account because otherwise many of the <unk> in Europe will be <unk>
Secondly, the increase in the opening up of the European market for agricultural products from third countries in return for the opening up of these countries to the export of European agricultural products and services is basically the realisation of the European Union of other countries with regard to concessions within the framework of the <unk> because the EU deserves to be more dependent on exports of <unk> than in the weak defence of agriculture, but it is unfortunately a further weakening of Europe's agricultural potential.
Thirdly and finally, the European Commission must respond much more quickly than hitherto to infringements of third countries from third countries against agreements on access to the European market, and whenever exports from these countries weaken production in Europe, the Commission must act immediately and not months later.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, this is a night of the <unk> with Mr Markov's report on the GSP and Mr <unk> report on non-tariff barriers, in other words, with the <unk> and <unk> and procedures that we call administrative protectionism or <unk>
Even though the WTO talks a lot about reducing the price of oil, we also have a <unk> protectionism in the form of quotas, but there is more than 110 <unk> Canada has <unk> and <unk> <unk> which prevents small countries from becoming industrialised countries, not to mention a list of sensitive products and a <unk> that makes respect for human rights a criterion, also the subjective <unk> to the value or the <unk>
Europe has more than 5 000 <unk>
In agriculture alone, there are <unk>
However, in Japan there are <unk> and in the United States, what are we doing about goods when it comes to <unk>
For example, how are we going to get a <unk> who is coming here from Egypt for an exhibition here?
We <unk> it as a <unk>
Mr <unk> report deals with all these problems and it is acknowledged that the United States has returned to a <unk> in the field of security in the area of security policy.
The era of Pope John Paul Paul Paul II with his famous <unk> of 1978 <unk> the borders of the States, political and economic systems, the broad areas of culture, civilisation and the progress of his <unk> power.
<unk> is not a <unk> <unk> that is why the ten years after the opening of the negotiations, the ten years after their opening up, when I can tell you that is only eight years.
Where are the roots of the <unk>
The problem stems from the fact that duties for 2000 are old and that the old Rome <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we live in the 21st century, and so we need a new <unk> Commissioner.
Fortunately, this new round of researchers has been invented by <unk> it is about <unk> customs duties that can be adapted according to the differences in production costs, tariffs that are traded on a stock stock and which can be modified to help developing countries.
That is why, Commissioner, you should put on the table at the WTO negotiations this new <unk> so that we can abolish our <unk> <unk>
(BG) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an extremely important report today.
efficient trade policy is an instrument for achieving regional or broader integration.
imports and exports based on reliable rules and methods will enable us to protect the European <unk>
The report is objective and critical, but also constructive.
There are several aspects of the focus of the focus on regional and multilateral benefits, the common regional opportunities and the strengthening of the competitiveness of the European Union through market-based instruments to prevent the exclusion of European products from the market.
Trade affects the economic growth of some countries.
From this point of view, <unk> and <unk> have an essential role to play.
It is particularly important to apply and control, especially for some new Member States such as Bulgaria, where higher levels of funding are essential for the creation of a <unk>
In this case, access to <unk> is crucial.
The <unk> of goods from the new countries to external markets which even make it difficult for all the requirements to comply with all requirements will lead to differences in treatment.
That is precisely why we need absolute agreement on the legislation and the implementing provisions.
The work of the national customs authorities is crucial to the smooth functioning of an efficient trading system, particularly in view of its extended tasks in combating counterfeiting and fraud, and in the protection of intellectual property rights and consumers.
The customs authorities of the Member States must organise their cooperation well.
It is equally important to take measures to motivate customs authorities within the framework of the administrative solutions of each Member State, as well as to protect and support the mandate of the <unk>
We could consider the setting up of <unk> centres in the trade with third countries or regions.
This would help to promote an efficient trade policy of the European Union.
(CS) Madam President, one point has not yet been addressed.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what steps the European Union has taken so far with regard to the rules applied by the United States?
In your opinion, how best can the Euro-Mediterranean partnership be best coordinated in the context of transatlantic relations, and do you really see a possibility of a balance between security measures and the need to make economic relations between Europe and the United States more <unk>
I am talking about the requirements for containers which Mr Audy also mentioned in his report.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking you for your interest and your contribution to improving our legislation and practices in the customs area.
I would like to focus on two <unk> the modernised Customs Code and the <unk> you will help to ensure that the EU's energy system becomes more efficient, faster and even cheaper.
I am, of course, available to Parliament to keep you informed of the most important developments in the field of <unk> and its implementation.
On 1 April, the Commission adopted a new communication on a strategy for further development of the Customs Union, confirmed by a Council resolution.
The future strategy on the basis of which the communication is based reinforces the <unk> by providing an appropriate and balanced response to the dual challenge that it <unk> on the one hand by guaranteeing security checks for goods at the external borders and, on the other, by facilitating trade.
To this end, the initiative is to replace the current <unk> approach to <unk> and <unk> by a systemic approach which focuses on internal control systems and the supply chain of the <unk>
Such a new approach requires new labour and security opportunities and a future <unk>
At the same time, it offers a platform for cooperation with the EU Member States in terms of the most appropriate financial instruments that should be used in future to guarantee the efficient functioning of the Customs Union.
On the question by Mrs Roithová on the initiative by the US Department of <unk> on the initiative of the United States of America, all containers from 2012 to <unk> before the adoption by Congress, we have made various efforts to amend the proposal, but <unk>
The government of the United States was very <unk> because it thought that the introduction of such measures, a unilateral step, would be contrary to our multilateral and multilateral approach.
The US Administration has realised that this is certainly not accompanied by any increase in security but, on the contrary, it creates a false sense of security, which would give resources and attention from the real security measures.
Our approach lies in the future recognition of safety standards, <unk> the results of security checks and mutual recognition of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the American side, as well as authorised economic operators on the part of the EU.
I mention this because, in conjunction with SMEs there have been some indications that the authorised <unk> system is a very useful system to make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises.
With the presentation of a report for Michael <unk> and the American customs and customs authorities, we have recently made important information available to the American Government and the report describes the difficulties that are likely to be associated with the introduction of the <unk> of all containers with <unk> <unk> the disruption of maritime transport and bilateral trade relations.
Just one <unk> in one year the United States received more than 10 million <unk> the EU sends around two million <unk>
If the system is introduced, more than 700 ports around the world would be affected by the problem of which problems are <unk>
I hope that not only the <unk> but the legislators will gradually realise that security does not increase but that there are serious problems in bilateral and multilateral trade.
Finally, as the report points out, the Customs Union is celebrating its <unk> <unk>
At the same time, this year marks a new start for the Community and Member States in this area.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner <unk>
Thank you for your answers, and I would also like to thank the Commission staff with whom I have worked together and the members of the Committee on International Trade, Mr <unk> and the rapporteurs of the political groups, such as Mr <unk>
I am also pleased to see his colleague, Mrs <unk> here today, with whom we have worked on another subject.
You were right to draw Mrs <unk> attention to the problem of <unk> <unk> and I thank you, Commissioner, for the determination with which you have defended us.
The EU has not been attacked for the first time on these issues by the United States, because we have had to defend our <unk> in a case that has been presented to the WTO panel of the WTO and which we have won partly because of the efforts of your staff, Commissioner.
You have rightly defended us.
Mr Martinez explained his theory of reversed customs duties.
He told me in December 2005 when we were together in Hong Kong.
I still do not understand them, but I live in the hope that I can understand one day how these reverse duties for <unk> and <unk> are to apply.
I would like to thank all the groups for the support they have given to this report.
I believe that people now realise that the world which is becoming increasingly complex and <unk> would have resolved conflicts in the past with a military war.
Today we are dealing with an economic and social war and not with military war.
Instead of dead, there are unemployed.
And we no longer really know who the opponents are.
In this climate of global economic and social war, we need a strong customs union, as well as the import and export markets that protect our economy, citizens and the European Union in general, and I am talking about protection, not protectionism.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Trafficking in human beings and human trafficking, especially women, for sexual exploitation (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation of Anna Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, to the Commission - <unk>
author. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, with these oral questions, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality wishes to draw attention to the enormous problem of trafficking in women and forced prostitution in the European Union.
It is true that there are no precise figures, but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of women and girls are victims of trafficking in human beings by criminal gangs and end up in our Member States in the <unk>
This is <unk> and unfortunately the action of the European Union and the Member States is practically ineffective.
<unk> such as important <unk> <unk> we know that criminal gangs carrying out such <unk> practices and therefore the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on 8 March 2006 launched a campaign to raise awareness of the need to prevent and combat illegal trafficking in women and forced prostitution.
This <unk> map for <unk> has been a great success and it has encouraged not only viewers and <unk> but in society as a whole to understand the need to actively combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution.
Unfortunately, the results achieved by the European Commission and most Member States are still disappointing.
We would therefore like to highlight this problem again and to remind the viewers and society as a whole during the 2008 <unk> of 2008 that this type of violence against women and girls is unacceptable.
In 2005, the Commission and the Council adopted a detailed action plan on the exchange of best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing fraud.
This action plan must be implemented immediately by the Member States.
This is also one of our questions.
<unk> measures are in fact coordinated measures in areas such as gender <unk> including in those countries from which these women and girls come, and the evaluation of their effectiveness.
Can the Commission therefore answer the following questions?
Has the action plan on illegal trafficking in women been implemented for sexual exploitation, with the result and the <unk>
What specific measures have been requested by the Member States to combat illegal trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.
To what extent have the Member States transposed Directive <unk> properly and have carried out and what measures have the Commission taken in cases where this has not been done?
Is the study carried out by the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality since January 2006 on the links between <unk> and the extent of illegal trafficking in women and <unk> for sexual exploitation.
Can the Commission tell us whether and how it intends to strengthen and continue cross-border police cooperation in the fight against illegal trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution.
How can the Commission support the Commission's <unk> map for <unk>
Would the Commissioner also be prepared to write to the governments of Austria and Switzerland and to ask them to fight trafficking in women and forced prostitution during the forthcoming 2008 <unk> and to support our <unk>
Madam President, as everyone knows, important <unk> are a source of joy and <unk> for the public and the <unk> but this is a problem that needs to be dealt with and paid attention to the events, not just in words, because - to quote a well-known Dutch <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I hope the Commissioner will also work for this.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, although the question is not in my <unk> I feel it is an honour for my esteemed friend and colleague Jacques Barrot to take this debate because I believe that this is a very important issue.
I would like to assure you that the Commission is fully committed to combating trafficking in human beings as a brutal violation of human rights and serious crime, focusing on the fight against forced prostitution.
I would like to start by answering the extremely important issues that affect all aspects of this complex problem.
The EU action plan launched by the Council in 2005 on common standards, good practices and common mechanisms contains a whole series of highly ambitious measures to combat trafficking in human beings.
On the basis of the information provided by the Member States, we have the impression that, despite some results, the situation remains unsatisfactory in the field of criminal law and in the area of justice which are both of particular importance.
The Commission will present a report at the end of the year on the implementation of the action plan.
This inventory could form the basis for a decision on what activities should be followed in the near future.
Secondly, the protection of victims of human trafficking is a <unk>
It is also a <unk> for the successful persecution of <unk> as the victim of the victim is of the greatest importance as evidence against the <unk>
Directive <unk> excludes this approach by granting victims a <unk> in which they can recover and the influence of the perpetrators and a residence permit.
All the Member States, with the exception of Spain and Luxembourg, with the exception of Spain and Luxembourg, the Commission officially informed the Commission of the full implementation of this legal instrument.
The Commission has decided to bring the two other Member States before the European Court of Justice.
For the purpose of analysing the relevant implementation of the directive into national law and its implementation, the Commission launched a study in January 2007 to evaluate the implementation of 10 directives, including this in the area of asylum and immigration.
The final results of the study that the Commission will shortly be available will provide the basis for systematic monitoring of existing Community law in this area in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
My third point is that the Commission has also launched an investigation to assess Member States' legislation and the situation in the area of human trafficking.
The results of the study will be presented at the end of February 2009.
Point 4: forced prostitution and trafficking in human beings constitute a violation of fundamental rights and form a form of organised crime.
Efforts to combat criminal networks must necessarily be transnational in nature.
Cross-border cooperation between the police forces of the Member States is preferably taking place via Europol.
In addition, the fight against trafficking in human beings is also a priority within the framework of the specific programme <unk> and <unk> to promote transnational criminal law enforcement agencies and NGOs.
Finally, Mr President, the <unk> map for <unk> launched by the World Cup in 2006, has made a positive contribution to <unk> the awareness of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.
Although the assessment carried out by Germany has shown that the fear of an increase in forced prostitution and trafficking in human beings was unfounded in 2006, we welcome all initiatives aimed at informing the public of their awareness of such heinous crimes and helping the victims.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, next Saturday, in Austria and Switzerland.
After the World Cup this is the second largest <unk>
It is expected that around 2.5 million people from the whole of Europe will follow the games at <unk>
It is estimated that a large number of women, in other words an estimated 25 000 women from all over the world, travel to cities in which the Games are <unk> but not only to <unk> their teams but because they are forced into prostitution.
I am sure that this will not allow the international community, especially the EU and the European Parliament to be <unk>
Madam President, Commissioner, as we have heard, the intervention of the European Parliament at the World Cup in Germany in 2006 in 2006 was positive.
According to reports, 40 000 to 60 000 women have been forced into prostitution.
So it should be worth doing so again this time, as in 2006 following an oral question by Mrs <unk>
I would suggest that the President of the European Parliament and the Commissioner responsible for the Commission should write a letter in the way that Mr Frattini wrote to Angela Merkel in 2006.
The letter should be addressed both to the <unk> and to UEFA and we should express our concern about the threat of the <unk> of a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> with women as victims.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we can agree and draw attention to our concerns, I am convinced that we will be able to achieve the dangers that neither us nor society, but rather the use of human suffering.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, a few days before <unk> the Women's Committee - and I hope the whole of the European Parliament - is once again the red <unk>
Up to 800 000 women are victims of trafficking in human beings worldwide for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
This is one of the most serious violations of human rights in today's time and particularly in sporting <unk> the rapid sex of the Games is also linked to this modern type of <unk>
Two years ago, we launched a broad debate on the <unk> in Germany here in Parliament and launched a campaign that ensured that the great wave of forced prostitution and the corresponding excesses with the support of fans were prevented by the <unk> public.
But then the issue has come back again.
We have initiated legal initiatives and with the experience we had of the German campaign which was very broadly <unk> by women's organisations, it has been possible to set up measures to protect victims and to present the <unk> of women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe.
They are in a state of <unk> both as a <unk> because they do not have residence permits, but on the other hand as victims because they are mercilessly exploited by the traffickers.
We have taken a step further in the measures to <unk> cross-border cooperation and the legal provision of <unk>
We now want to use the Games in Austria and Switzerland in Switzerland to raise the issue once again.
In Germany, the Social Democratic Party <unk> has announced draconian penalties for <unk>
However, there are still many gaps and Parliament must ensure that these gaps are closed.
I ask the Commission to support us in this.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that it is symbolic that we are discussing <unk> issues in the middle of the night.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of women are abused in European <unk>
This industry is experiencing a rapid increase and united in new technologies, crime, drugs and the big money, despite the fact that they are combined with a single word of violence.
It is well known that most women are leaving themselves in the <unk> <unk> because of poor social conditions - particularly poverty and unemployment.
Most prostitutes come from precisely those areas where unemployment is particularly high, in the case of the European Union from the poorer Eastern European countries.
This proves that the European Union and its Member States must above all ensure that women from vulnerable groups have better professional qualifications and that they must take active action in this regard.
There is no doubt that campaigns to raise awareness of the problem of prostitution - such as the <unk> card for <unk> - are important and society for a certain period of time will be more sensitive to this problem.
However, I believe that the fight against forced prostitution and the commercial exploitation of women must always be at the heart of social and public attention.
I believe that it is often much more important for society to finance preventive measures and preventive measures rather than constantly dealing with the consequences of the problem.
In addition to preventive measures, it is important to increase the effectiveness of police cooperation between the Member States, especially in the field of transport.
I call on the Commission and the political groups represented here to act decisively in favour of the abolition of prostitution and to ensure that it is prohibited in the countries of origin of prostitutes to use their services.
If demand is <unk> we will ultimately achieve our goal.
Finally, it must also be stressed that there must be a <unk> of prostitution and trafficking in human beings throughout the European Union.
We should start to take decisions and take action.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we know that trafficking in women for sexual exploitation must be banned and combated throughout the world.
It is a scandal that is not worthy of a Europe of values and human rights.
We also know that trafficking in women is no longer <unk>
That is why we need a European response to the problem, but it must be far more than just border controls and <unk>
It is generally positive that this issue has been on the agenda for around ten years, but the focus is too one-sided on border controls - prevention and protection of victims, unfortunately.
There is no <unk>
More and more people - girls and women - are victims of sexual exploitation, <unk> as Mrs Gröner has already mentioned, the <unk> rise in 2006 was not recorded in 2006.
However, we know that the <unk> is high.
There are too few <unk> against traffickers and too few procedures against unscrupulous <unk>
This has also been confirmed by the European Commission to a parliamentary question.
We are relying on improved protection for victims not only in Germany, but in Europe.
As far as this is concerned, I find it somewhat regrettable that the Commission appears to be only fine words and that the improvement of the victims does not make it possible for victims to be improved.
It is not transparent how the Commission is going to be able to carry out its implementation in the Member States for the implementation of the environmental legislation in the Member States.
I find it very regrettable that the Commission also refers to a study on my second parliamentary question as to how the <unk> in Germany is being implemented.
I would like to ask the Commission to finally take a position on whether the <unk> has been correctly implemented, not only in Germany but also in the other EU Member States.
Surely the Commission cannot know whether its own law has been properly implemented.
That would be a <unk>
With regard to migration, we need to see not only the <unk> but also the ways in which women can legally <unk> so that they do not have to go into the hands of traffickers.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of women and children are transported in the EU like goods.
They are being exploited sexually exploited, <unk> abuse and any human dignity.
What did they have to say about such a <unk>
Well, their crime is poverty and lack of social rights and the fact that there are men who believe that their money would have the right to use women and children like goods.
Often, young girls are being <unk> with false promises of work and good money, but then the <unk>
It is a disgrace for the EU and the <unk> that this trade can continue and even increase it.
No one can <unk> he did not know anything.
We know it, but too little is being done.
That is why we now need a response from the Commission to our question in connection with the <unk> map for <unk>
I maintain that <unk> is a form of terrorism.
The EU and the Member States are very effective in the <unk> of more or less good <unk>
But this other terrorism, which affects women and children, does not enjoy the same priority, neither in the EU nor in the Member States.
We must also recognise that more and more men are involved in this tragic trade.
Men must not only be able to rely on the purchase of sexual services.
They must also show other men that it is not in order to buy women's bodies.
It is up to men to ensure that demand and hence trade in women are reduced.
As long as there is a demand and a market with great financial assets, trade will continue.
I repeat: women are not <unk>
We must put an end to this.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the resolution on the future of the <unk> which we adopted on these same benches last year, we expressly call on the Council to take measures to combat criminal activities in the <unk> including forced prostitution.
That is what this text <unk>
To <unk> the appearance of these phenomena on the margins of important <unk> is not the fault of the <unk>
They are almost in favour of all international <unk>
However, sport has every interest in addressing this problem effectively and vigorously because it makes little sense, ladies and gentlemen, that we advocate more fair <unk> in stadiums and combat racism by means of words and actions, when cases of slavery are tolerated.
The <unk> card for <unk> has worked very well during the 2006 part-session in Germany.
In this respect, around 1 000 local and regional <unk> and associations, which had clearly had a deterrent effect on traffickers and other criminal networks.
The result - as the Commissioner has already pointed out - that forced prostitution in Germany was limited to a few dozen cases in Germany and that these were generally not directly linked to the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are therefore obviously successful.
They are extremely <unk> which is why new use needs to be made of it, even during the forthcoming programming period which begins this week.
That is why, Commissioner, we call on the European Commission to send a letter to the competent governments, namely Austria and Switzerland, as Mrs Wortmann-Kool has just said.
I repeat our question: can you fulfil our request and confirm here and now that you will support this initiative?
Allow me to say one more thing: prevention alone will not suffice.
The Member States agreed in 2005 that trafficking in human beings should be <unk> but the action plan which you referred to was more than ever dead at national level.
It is therefore time to remind the authorities of this action plan.
Two years ago, the then Commissioner Frattini called for the role of Europol and Eurojust to be strengthened in this context, and Parliament made the same request in its resolution.
We therefore trust that the Commission and the Council will make greater efforts in the face of the forthcoming <unk> the Commission and the Council will do more to fulfil these commitments.
Madam President, Commissioner, human trafficking, as we have heard, is a crime against humanity, especially women - a new form of slavery and a very profitable business - with EUR 44 billion in turnover per year according to the OSCE.
It is worth discussing it longer and also showing a variety of facets of it.
We are now dealing with trafficking in women or forced prostitution to the action we had already made in Germany in 2006.
There has also been a report here in the House which I have been able to draw up on forced prostitution and in which we asked the Commission to take various measures.
The action plan was the action plan.
The question of implementation has already been raised several times today, and I would like to stress that it is a question of residence permits for victims, <unk> <unk> and so on, and it is also about providing information in the countries of origin and education and training for women on the ground and also for young men.
These are also more and more affected.
<unk> is 18 October as an international day against trafficking in women, which we were able to carry out last year.
Otherwise, I cannot see a great deal of progress from the action.
Attention has also been paid to this issue after the <unk> and after the <unk> <unk> and we therefore want to see a new <unk>
This is not about the prohibition of prostitution or about discrimination against <unk> and <unk>
On the contrary!
It is about raising awareness and raising awareness of the need to reject a social network in order to protect <unk> and <unk> in their profession.
<unk> is the condemnation of the <unk>
The <unk> in Austria and Switzerland gives us the opportunity to draw attention to this.
I can assure you that the Austrian authorities will take the appropriate measures and invite them most warmly to become a beautiful European Cup and want fair and fair <unk>
Madam President, many people look forward to the <unk> in June 2008.
However, we must not forget that outside the Games of trafficking in human beings, forced prostitution and child prostitution are rising and the crime of trafficking in human beings <unk> all the borders.
The Games will take place in Austria and Switzerland, which will strengthen the role of neighbouring Central European countries as transit countries for the very lucrative criminal business.
Here the EU is asking for <unk> cross-border monitoring and prosecution must be better organised and coordinated.
European mechanisms for joint investigation must be improved.
Every Member State is called upon to better protect victims and actively use these instruments.
Only in this way can we be left out of the hands of the perpetrators and the red card.
(PT) It is extremely important that we use the Euro 2008 European Cup to remind the public that prostitution and the very lucrative trafficking of women are unacceptable for sexual exploitation, as they are forms of violence against women, girls and children.
It is therefore important to take measures to effectively combat this trade while at the same time supporting the victims in the various Member States; it is also necessary to report on the results of the actions carried out.
However, we must not lose sight of the worsening of the inequalities, precarious and poorly paid work, unemployment and poverty that are pushing thousands of women and young girls into prostitution and facilitating human traffickers.
There is therefore another question: what will those responsible in the EU do to combat the root causes of these serious violations of the human rights of hundreds of thousands of women and young girls and put an end to this modern slavery.
(NL) Madam President, during the 2006 part-session, it was also pointed out that the need for a training policy for victims of trafficking in women and forced prostitution.
For example, in Turkey, for years, there has been a <unk> company which can be called upon by women to report cases of trafficking in women.
The European Parliament had already called for the creation of a multilingual <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> for victims of human trafficking.
However, it is still not a matter of two years after it has not yet been done.
Two weeks ago, as Commissioner Kuneva I was launching a <unk> for <unk> consumers during Euro 2008.
What a brilliant idea of setting up a single telephone number.
So it is quite <unk> which is why consumers will help, not the victims of the <unk>
This new <unk> shows how quickly action can be taken and that it is possible to do so.
These initiatives must now be combined and the victims of trafficking in women are given a means to ask for help.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
(SV) Madam President, on Sunday there is an impetus for the <unk> and the party can begin to do so.
But the coin also has a <unk>
In sporting events of this magnitude the illegal trafficking of women and young girls for purposes of prostitution is increasing.
It is therefore important that we react and act, just as we did two years ago with the blue card for <unk>
It is essential that we join forces in the EU and stand together for zero tolerance for human trafficking.
I therefore appeal to all the governments of the EU Member States who have not yet done so to implement the action plan for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings from the EU in 2005.
I wish more countries would have laws relating to the purchase of sexual services, because this clearly has a preventive effect on the fight against fraud.
I also look forward to the report presented by the Commission on prostitution in the Member States, and I hope that we can read it out soon.
The <unk> should be characterised both by the <unk> and outside the values of <unk> <unk> health and <unk>
Anyone who does not condemn the trafficking of human beings is supporting it.
Madam President, the <unk> may be an illegal market, but it is nevertheless a market with supply and demand.
A country where there is a high demand plays an equally active role in the trafficking of human beings, such as a <unk>
Apart from the fact that it is a <unk> of slavery in our time, trafficking in human beings is continuing to violate and violation of the law, with other criminal practices linked to money laundering, violence, forced prostitution, prostitution, prostitution, fraud and <unk>
Trafficking in human beings creates a dangerous reversal of our society by maintaining old inequalities - women and children are considered to be a commodity.
The money earned by traffickers undermines faith in the value of work and honest <unk>
All Member States urgently need to ratify the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human <unk> and implement the agreed measures and, first of all, to eliminate the <unk> of human trafficking for prostitution, namely male demand for women and girls.
(SK) The <unk> <unk> 2008, which begins next Saturday in Austria and Switzerland, reminds us of the issue of <unk>
Those who value good football will certainly have a great time.
Unfortunately, however, these sporting events also provide fertile ground for <unk> and there is an increased risk that more human trafficking will be used for sexual exploitation.
I share the view of the other speakers that the so-called <unk> which was initiated by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in March 2006 was successful because they were one of the most pressing social issues.
I am convinced that only a good information campaign carried out during the 2008 European Championships on the absolute prevention of trafficking in women and forced prostitution will open the eyes of people and bring this terrible form of violence against girls and women.
(DA) Madam President, I would like to address my question as to what specific initiatives were taken to prevent trafficking in women in the context of the 2008 gas pipeline in Austria and Switzerland.
Finally, we have heard here tonight - and experience from the past taught us - that trafficking in women is taking place in the context of sporting <unk> of this kind.
I have the following questions.
Firstly, has contact with the governments of the two countries been included, and have they been asked to support the <unk> card for Parliament's <unk>
Secondly, were they pointing out that policing must be intensified during the European <unk>
Thirdly, were the two governments called upon to take measures to support the victims of the <unk>
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as many speakers have said, and as I have already said, before the World Cup in 2006, similar initiatives and proposals were submitted by Parliament and the Commission and adopted by the Commission and the Commission.
Fortunately, the fears and fears of the German authorities and the European institutions have not <unk>
However, this is certainly not a reason to get to the end of the day, and we cannot do anything about it, and this debate is more than justified because it is certainly better to be on the safe side and better than necessary.
It is also reasonable to use this opportunity to take stock of the measures taken and to enable Parliament to submit proposals to the Commission and to provide an excellent opportunity for the public.
I can understand the dissatisfaction of some of the speakers.
In my opening remarks, I have explained how many specific reports the Commission has in its work and we now have the results and the conclusions on which further action and action programmes can be based.
Mrs Bozkurt mentioned the issue of the hotlines and I believe that this is a good idea, although it is not easy to implement.
The hotline for consumer protection is quite different.
I am therefore of the opinion that the hotline set up by my colleague, Commissioner <unk> cannot be used for the protection of victims, for example, because this is a completely different matter, which is much more complicated.
Mrs Breyer has also referred to victim protection, which I believe is an important key issue.
I would like to point out that the report on the evaluation and monitoring of the action plan will contain a separate chapter on <unk> which will be available in October or November 2008.
We will assess the real implementation of measures to protect victims.
On the first European day against trafficking in human beings, which took place on 18 October 2007, recommendations published in relation to the identification of victims of trafficking in human beings and their referral to relevant posts were published in the first European day.
I assure you that we are firmly committed to providing an appropriate <unk> and I would also like to assure Members that the Commission is prepared to step up the fight against trafficking, forced prostitution and the organised crime behind it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
At a time when football fans throughout Europe are <unk> the launch of the euro in 2008, it is necessary to reflect on the dangers for women, especially from former <unk> who are victims of trafficking in human beings and are subjected to forced prostitution in order to meet the demand for sexual services on the margins of <unk>
What for many people is a <unk> celebration of the best European traditions in sport, for those unfortunate young women who believe in their naivety to be restricted to <unk> or <unk> as a period of physical and mental suffering.
It is time to call on the rest of the 17 Member States of the European Union, who have not yet ratified the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human <unk> to comply with this obligation without delay.
<unk> human rights defenders are not an excuse for the <unk> of the convention adopted in Warsaw over three years ago.
Could the Commission clarify the progress made in implementing the plan for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings in Europe?
Since I am concerned about the delay in implementing the plan by the Member States, I call on the Commission to indicate what consequences it will be for the <unk> card for <unk> in the Member States.
Could she also tell us what campaign it intends to raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking for prostitution during the 2008 <unk>
I am deeply concerned that <unk> the millions of people throughout the world are being <unk> as a means of exploiting women and girls.
I am shocked that approximately 100 000 women are victims of trafficking in human beings in Europe.
What I am most concerned about is the fact that even girls are affected by the age of 14 <unk>
We cannot tolerate this form of modern slavery.
Sexual exploitation is not only a crime but also a gross violation of human rights.
in writing. - (HU) The Union is committed to preventing sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings in the context of <unk> organised on their territory.
The 2008 <unk> is a <unk> event where a significant number of people are <unk> and demand for sexual services is temporarily increasing.
That is why it is important to protect ourselves with fixed-term campaigns such as Mrs Záborská in 2006 on the occasion of the <unk> initiative, and this time it is worth <unk>
In order to be able to achieve as many people as possible, I believe that we need more information in the media (including the official website for <unk> involving politicians, <unk> sportsmen and fans <unk> the Youth against <unk>
However, a temporary campaign is not enough.
In order to be able to act effectively against traffickers in human beings, new directives need to be drafted as soon as possible, but above all already existing directives.
I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that there are shortcomings in the implementation and interpretation of directives in many countries, so that their application is delayed further.
That is why I think it is particularly important that Mrs <unk> s question on Directive <unk> is specifically answered.
Even if border controls play an important role in the detection of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings in the Union, we will not achieve the objective in my view with stricter internal border controls and will need to strengthen border controls through cooperation with <unk> with a suitable form of cooperation in the form of this cooperation.
This will not allow people to take part in European events in European events.
in writing. - (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to return to Mrs <unk> question and to refer you once again to the <unk> of Roma women in the areas of human trafficking and forced prostitution.
Social exclusion - and often the absence of printed documents - leads to the fact that <unk> are particularly often victims and a <unk> <unk> for those who benefit from trafficking.
Their situation is also exacerbated by the <unk> prejudices which affect them as a whole in their own communities and the sexual prejudices that exist in their own communities and the general distrust of the Roma.
Individual programmes are needed to help victims of traffickers and their families and to prevent <unk> girls being forced to live and work in a <unk> <unk>
The creation of more <unk> and <unk> through NGOs and the Member States is crucial to the collection and evaluation of reliable statistics on the link between Roma communities and Roma communities.
In the latter area, some NGOs and international organisations can produce results, but the European Commission and the Member States must also be more involved.
However, the most important breeding ground for trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation is poverty, which reduces human life on a daily basis, with a significant increase in the risk of illegal activity if financial opportunities and <unk> are lacking.
For this reason, our common first duty is to put an end to inhumane poverty and help to those who have already become victims of inhumane poverty.

(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, yesterday on the <unk> - the security system of the European Community - was triggered by a <unk> <unk> at a nuclear power station at a Slovenian nuclear power station.
Then there was <unk> but there are doubts about the true nature of this <unk> and the reasons for this extremely unusual <unk>
We would therefore like the Commission to be present today and take advantage of Slovenia to hold the Presidency and the Commission to ask the European Parliament and the public to inform the public about the real reasons for triggering this extremely unusual procedure.
I would be grateful if you could respond to this request.
I think that the Slovenian Presidency, which is here today, is in line with this request.
<unk> Union for the Mediterranean (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the <unk> Union for the Mediterranean.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today I think I should speak French, and I will do so.
First of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for putting the point on our relations with our ACP partners on the agenda of this plenary session.
This suggests a debate on an issue that is of vital importance for Europe and I very simply welcome the role of the European Parliament which has repeatedly devoted itself to the Mediterranean in the last few years.
The Barcelona Process has enabled us to discuss many strategic regional issues and, of course, political issues.
I believe that a great deal has been created, but there are many common challenges ahead of us, including security, environmental protection, sustainability of energy, the fight against organised crime, the management of migratory flows and intercultural dialogue.
Beyond this cooperation with our <unk> I would like to extend the understanding of others and their interests, respect but also mutual trust.
In March of this year, the European Council called on the Commission to redefine the modalities for the <unk> Union for the <unk> and the Commission adopted a communication on 20 May that highlights the central position of the Mediterranean, its historical and current importance and the major challenges for our common future.
However, I would also like to say that of course the European Neighbourhood Policy remains a bilateral policy, while the other is a regional policy.
We must also bear in mind that the existing action plans implement the decisions taken by the various sectoral <unk>
When you think of the Mediterranean, you think of the cradle of the three <unk> religions, the <unk> of civilisation and of the culture, migration and trade.
We are thinking of the history of the Mediterranean, which is inextricably linked to Europe.
The Mediterranean is the interface between north and south, between <unk> and south, and the <unk> of three continents is more than a simple border for the European Union.
The stability of this region is essential, both for our security and prosperity and for those of our neighbours and friends in the Mediterranean.
With a targeted and realistic political action, with strong and constant commitment, we will be able to meet these challenges together.
The Commission has always fought for <unk> more constructive relations with our ACP partners and we are putting forward concrete proposals to achieve this.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me today to present to you the most important findings and proposals of the communication that I presented to the College.
Unfortunately, the Barcelona Process has suffered from the <unk> of the conflicts of south of the Mediterranean and sometimes from the lack of cooperation between the various partners, but it has now been a positive development - as I saw during my recent visits to the region.
The time has come to use a new political will to give our cooperation new impetus and to make it more balanced and closer to the citizens.
Three objectives are essential for us.
Firstly, strengthening the political level of the European Union's relations with its <unk> secondly, a better division of responsibility in our multilateral relations with them, and thirdly, promoting additional regional and regional projects that will benefit the citizens of the region and make these relations more concrete and more visible.
There would be a great added value here.
Of course, private funds will be used - since so far it has been the Community sector alone - the private sector is now being added.
Of course we have to see whether this really works, but that is the idea.
It is therefore essential to strengthen the level of our relations.
The Commission is proposing to organise every two years of Heads of State or Government.
It would be hard to understand why we are organising regular summits with our important partners throughout the world, but not having a conflict between Heads of State or Government with our neighbours and friends in the Mediterranean.
Moreover, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has proved to be the parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona process.
It offers a favourable <unk> for debates, open dialogues and free movement of people.
It gives impetus to the partnership by adopting resolutions and recommendations and will be the legitimate parliamentary representation of the Union for the Mediterranean.
The Commission fully supports the strengthening of the role of the parliamentary assembly in its relations with the <unk>
A better division of responsibility is also essential.
For several years there has been a widespread and fundamental idea that the Barcelona agenda has been influenced by the fact that the Presidency of the European Union also holds the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
Three proposals have been accepted by the general agreement of the partners and a country from the south and a country from the North and a country from the north, a joint standing committee with headquarters in Brussels, and a secretariat for the <unk>
Finally, as Robert Schuman said, we need concrete projects, the <unk> a de facto solidarity.
A prerequisite for the success of the initiative will be the quality of the projects that are jointly implemented.
It will bring the strength of the links between the two shores of the Mediterranean to the citizens.
Projects have to be projects that have an impact on the region and enable non-state actors to involve civil society and businesses.
Europe must be a lever for private capital to be <unk>
For example, the Commission proposes the promotion of <unk> linking the Arab <unk> the promotion of solar energy and the fight against pollution of the Mediterranean.
Of course, this list is open and further projects will follow.
Madam President, I would like to conclude by mentioning one point which I believe is essential.
This renewed cooperation with our partners in the South must certainly not be at the expense of our policies and solid ties with our neighbours in the east.
On the contrary, in addition to our efforts to strengthen individual ties with our friends in the East, the Commission is deepening regional cooperation with its initiative.
We will soon publish the annual report on the first anniversary of this project on the occasion of the first anniversary of this project, and we will be able to discuss the recent initiative of Poland and the Swedish Presidency.
By means of these efforts in the east and the south, we will be able to enrich our relations with flexible policies aimed at our partners' priorities.
Honourable Members, the Paris Summit is a real opportunity to give a new dimension to our relations with our partners.
No one should lose sight of the lessons of the past, but we must not be <unk> and the Union for the <unk> <unk> will open a new era in our relations with our neighbours in the south, a new partnership based on the fruitful elements of the Middle East peace process, together with our common objectives of peace, democracy and prosperity.
Madam President, forgive me, Madam President, if I have spoken a little long while I think that is an important issue for me and for all of us.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group looks forward to Commissioner <unk> statement today.
I would like to thank her once again and say that we have read with interest the Commission's communication adopted on 20 May.
We congratulate President Sarkozy, because he has put the stone in the direction of the European Council' s <unk> and a renewal of our Mediterranean policy, which my group supports and which I hope will come to a speedy and speedy conclusion.
We know how difficult it is to pursue the ambitious objectives of the Barcelona process.
One is the unresolved conflict in the Middle East and the tensions in Western Sahara.
It is also the <unk> which is sometimes separated from the <unk> economic and social policies of our partner countries, and thus hinders the realisation of the objectives we have set ourselves.
All this is serious and makes it difficult for the situation to be used as justification for delays or <unk>
We believe that President Sarkozy's political initiative and the support of the European Commission go in the right direction, that is to say, they give substance to our political aspirations and make them more specific.
To this end, the Commission has identified four projects mentioned earlier this morning by the Commissioner to deal with the activities already planned for <unk> <unk> <unk> in the Mediterranean, <unk> cooperation in the field of civil protection for natural disasters and, finally, a Mediterranean programme for the Mediterranean.
Each of these projects is important, and that is why we will be discussing this later when the Commission has given us more details.
These projects will act as an incredibly powerful driving force and give new impetus both to the Barcelona Process and to the measures which have already been completed but which are not yet complete.
I would like to remind you of the <unk> planned for 2010, and we would like to hear more, Commissioner, as well as the state of the implementation of the objectives and other current projects in the association agreements.
Finally, with regard to the specific measures implemented within reasonable time, I would also like to mention that not only the <unk> and the <unk> but also the <unk> which link the southern Mediterranean countries must be given fresh impetus and this system must be linked to Europe.
Last but not least, it is necessary to provide support to deal with water and water resources in the Middle East.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to two issues.
The first concerns the administration and operation of the <unk>
The European Union has also assumed significant commitments in the Middle East, and we expect it to follow these commitments as well.
Can the Council tell us what <unk> practical prospects in this direction are <unk>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not share the view of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that it is appropriate this morning to speak in French.
(FR) I say this in my mother tongue, Commissioner, my favourite language, but I believe that this morning it would be <unk> French, because the mistake made by President Sarkozy was that he initially had the impression that he had the impression that the Union was a <unk> idea for the Mediterranean.
But now it has become more sensible and it must be congratulated on it, Mr <unk>
I must remind you once again that I am reminded of Mr Sarkozy, when he came to Parliament at the beginning of the Conference of Presidents to present the Mediterranean Union for the first time, the question of what role the Federal Republic of Germany is playing in your Mediterranean Union and replied to me: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the meantime, we are somewhat further and we have now regulated these issues.
That is why the approach described by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is the right one.
I firmly believe that we have three key challenges in the Mediterranean Union.
First of all, I believe that the question of social stability is the basic prerequisite for peace, but nowhere is social stability at risk in the north and south than in the Mediterranean area.
Nowhere is the immediate confrontation of huge wealth on the one hand and enormous poverty on the one hand and enormous poverty - almost with hands - than the Mediterranean and nowhere are the confrontation and the tension associated with us Europeans more than in the Mediterranean.
That is why the Mediterranean Union is a project which can lead to greater stability and peace through the economic integration of our two regions and which is a very good idea, and we therefore support this idea as a Social Democrat and Social Democrats.
Secondly, the idea is all the more sensible because it makes the approach of multilateralism to the basis of cooperation, not only within the framework of the <unk> but also as a project of regional cooperation, which cannot have <unk> for the world, but which could create joint initiatives that can lead to a greater degree of stability throughout the world.
The third point that is so important for us as Social Democrats and Social Democrats is that it has now been managed not to set up a <unk>
The Barcelona Process - in the context of the financial perspective up to 2013 - is about EUR <unk> billion available in the context of the recitals which I have just outlined and which have been the political basis of the Mediterranean Union and which are now being strengthened by the Mediterranean Union to a new level, but without additional institutions, but within the framework of the <unk>
That is why the role of the Commission and our role as a Parliament - and indeed the role of the <unk> - is a <unk> and one that is already defined and which does not require any additional institutions or bureaucracies to demand and demand it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and the concrete objectives are now on the right track.
That is why we must also celebrate on 14 July in Paris.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with its proposals for a Mediterranean Union, President Sarkozy said that what many people knew about but did not recognise that the Barcelona Process and European interests had been <unk> that our partners in the south of the south were <unk> and the <unk> between the Mediterranean has been strengthened.
If Europe is serious about making the mistakes of the last ten years and pushing ahead with development and security at its southern borders, we must now learn to learn not only to take it but also to <unk>
We must build on the ashes of the Barcelona Process - a true partnership based on trust, reciprocity and, above all, mutual respect.
The Mediterranean must not be a cultural border but must become a <unk>
Joint investment in infrastructure - ports, energy networks and energy networks - brings our peoples much more together than the <unk> declarations that the Barcelona Process <unk>
We must also invest in human beings.
The kind of energy brought together after the last great war in France and Germans must now be invested in order to bring Europeans closer to each other in order to avoid another major war.
The worst mistake that the French Presidency could make would be to make promises of the European Union - and its citizens - for a <unk> project without the multiannual funding for such cooperation.
And, as Mr Schulz said, the creation of a complete bureaucratic structure in parallel with the delegations already existing and the External Action Service cannot be the right way to focus on values.
Despite the worsening situation, particularly in Egypt and Israel, as well as the fact that we call such values as the basis of EU foreign policy, the Commission proposals can only be found in the Commission's proposals.
I hope the Commission will address this aspect.
Despite these objections, Liberals and Democrats are happy to support the Mediterranean Union with an important <unk> pragmatic cooperation in economic matters must not be a substitute for peace efforts by the common foreign and security policy in the Middle East in the Middle East, which was agreed in the Treaty of Lisbon.
Since the Commissioner recognises the link between economic development and peace, what would be a better sign of peace and good will towards our Arab neighbours than the abolition of <unk>
Our much-vaunted free trade agreements have not managed to increase living standards because they have excluded agriculture and the services sector, which accounts for two thirds of GDP in the Middle East and North Africa.
If we do not adopt the products of these countries, we will ultimately have to accept their people.
A reform of the CAP, the level playing field for goods from the southern Mediterranean would be a major step towards tackling the causes of mass migration to Europe.
As the unique Dr <unk> once said, the life of <unk> is required.
And Europe must take the first step for the sake of the Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, the European Commission has made a good proposal.
It has made a rather <unk> political initiative, the <unk> in a renewed political ambition for a stronger Barcelona process.
This is an excellent thing, and in this context the Commission will have an excellent role to play.
We support its proposals, particularly with the aim of involving the institutions of the future project in the perspective of the Lisbon Treaty and its ambition for a more coherent and better integrated foreign policy in the Union.
This gives them the justified fears that political decisions are being taken ad hoc ad hoc decisions within the framework of <unk> à la carte or ever in the circumstances that are being fuelled by President Sarkozy's <unk> initiatives, for example in favour of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region.
The moderate achievements in the field of democracy and human rights were unanimously seen as obstacles to the Barcelona targets in 2005.
That is why the European Parliament insists that all mechanisms for strengthening democracy and the rule of law, but also for the parliamentary dimension of the process and the participation of civil society, in the context of this new ambition for the Middle East peace process.
We have an amendment to the Middle East conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Parliament would be well advised to vote in favour of this motion.
This is not the way to bind any new initiative in the region to resolving the conflict, but it would also be totally inappropriate to deny its negative impact on the specific skills of the development of the <unk> which would be useful for citizens.
Moreover, the <unk> who has just returned from Palestine, has documented serious violations of humanitarian law and human rights as well as clear violations of the Oslo and <unk> obligations.
We should not believe that the persistence of this situation does not seriously undermine mutual trust between partners and civil societies in the region, which is vital to the success of our Euro-Mediterranean ambitions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the European Union has many so-called old neighbours in the south and many so-called new neighbours in the east.
For the southern neighbours there is an instrument for external cooperation, which is currently being strengthened and should be strengthened.
However, none of these countries are involved in membership.
In the case of the eastern neighbours who are involved in the neighbourhood policy, the accession of EU accession is certainly an option.
Membership is not the aim of effective cooperation, but a successful neighbourhood policy can set the course.
The Barcelona Process needs new political impetus because the neighbourhood policy of the neighbourhood policy does not fit the east or the south.
It is therefore entirely appropriate that almost parallel projects were put on the European agenda for the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean region.
As Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Georgia are our neighbours, I very much hope that the Eastern Partnership and the South will not compete with each other in a <unk> manner but complement each other.
For example, if we want to achieve something in the negotiations on the budget, we must <unk>
Mutual political solidarity is called for when the Eastern and southern aspects of the neighbourhood policy are formulated in the Neighbourhood Policy.
We also urgently need to make our policy for the South and the East more political, political, economically and in the area of aid measures.
That is why I very much welcome the fact that the political framework of the neighbourhood policy is strengthened and renewed with the countries of the Mediterranean region.
We support projects in the fields of <unk> communication and energy.
We also support institutional reforms for the South.
We are relying on the fact that the policy towards the east will be strengthened in the future with <unk> commitment.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the relationship between Europe and the peoples of the Mediterranean region is far more than a simple neighbourhood.
The future of peace may be the future of peace in this zone which is the <unk> par excellence.
The reasons for this situation are obvious.
First of all, the economic <unk>
<unk> years after the launch of the Barcelona Process, not only did the promised divided prosperity have been <unk> but the <unk> has increased.
In fact, the <unk> of free trade is the <unk> of <unk>
In order to achieve this tomorrow, what has failed yesterday is a change of direction.
I do not see it.
The second problem is the <unk> treatment of migrants.
The people of these countries are very <unk>
It wants to live and does not recognise the future.
Although they are deeply linked to their soil, their culture, the history of their civilisation - whether they like Mr Berlusconi or not - they are directed at Europe and they see that their <unk> brothers are exposed to the well-known attacks from the hunting of <unk> to <unk> to <unk>
In this respect, too, a dramatic gap has been created.
When we talk about the dialogue of cultures and the approximation of peoples, without breaking down these practices, it is simply credible.
Finally, there is the European lack of action in relation to the <unk>
I am told that the Union and its Member States are <unk> the first donors for Palestine, and that is a good thing.
However, every observer will confirm as the whole delegation of our Parliament has done from the Middle East that, without a strong European commitment in political terms, this aid will actually solve nothing.
In other words, what is expected of Europe south of the Mediterranean is that it is at last what the former representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr de <unk> has rightly described as the <unk> of Israel with regard to the constant violation of international law and its own commitments.
Israel needs to understand - and the Union has a duty to contribute to this - that the normalisation of its relations with the whole region has a price, and that price is no more and no less than what the Arab League, the Quartet’s peace initiative or the <unk> Declaration and the <unk> of the Palestinian State in the <unk>
The European position on this issue is perhaps the key criterion for the success or failure of any attempt to reopen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
It would therefore be a good thing if the Association Council on 16 June were serious about 16 June when it examined the Israeli call for an increase in the status of its partnership with the Union.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I was asked to speak today about <unk>
This is the <unk> attempt to create a bloc of the entire Mediterranean that is to connect Europe with North Africa.
The architects of this project seemed to be a brilliant <unk> Europe would bring wealth and technology to North Africa and North Africa would supply Europe cheap labour, oil and gas.
In reality, it is a terrible idea.
We have already seen what happens if people from poor countries are allowed freedom of movement to richer countries.
Can you imagine what is going to happen only when North Africa gets that right.
In times of increased international terror, is it really a good idea to allow freedom of movement from countries in which we know <unk> <unk>
It should be said that Europe has learnt its lesson after the terrible terrorist attacks in Madrid and London.
Obviously not!
Let us also talk about oil and gas.
The North African countries know that Europe can be put under pressure.
Is it really a good idea to put our energy security in the hands of the military dictatorship in Algeria or by Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, who both know how vulnerable we are <unk>
I urge the EU to put an end to this project.
There was already a <unk> Mare <unk>
We do not need a <unk>
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner.
The Mediterranean is the zone in which all the <unk> <unk> <unk> historic <unk> - in <unk> <unk> - and even philosophical <unk> between the <unk> thinking and the logical thinking, but at the same time, in the East and the West, of Egypt and in the West of Egypt, then <unk> of Omar <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> in Syria to the <unk>
At the same time, the Mediterranean is the hope of three <unk> religions and the civilisation of <unk> and <unk> but not of the <unk> and the <unk> or the <unk> of <unk>
The Mediterranean Union therefore does not reduce the fight against pollution and civil security.
That would be a matter for the <unk>
The Mediterranean cannot be with 44 senior officials from Brussels from <unk> the capital of the Mediterranean and why not also a <unk> in order to be able to study Community law at the <unk> of <unk>
The Mediterranean <unk> the issues of women and men in the Mediterranean, which means prosperity, for example, for the fishermen who are now making it clear that peace is in the West in the west of Morocco and in the East, in Palestine.
Commissioner, Mrs Benita <unk> we need <unk> which are big enough to lose sight of them, and for that reason we do not create a Union without the people of the Mediterranean.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has played an important role in Europe's external relations since the beginning of the European unification process.
The Treaty of Rome has already seen special relations with certain Mediterranean countries.
The Mediterranean policy and the international situation have helped to develop our institutional framework, as the region has always been a scene for international challenges and problems.
As is well known, we have not <unk> the ambitious objectives that we set in Barcelona in 1995, which is why we have developed new objectives in 2005.
Our <unk> have undoubtedly given us many opportunities for bilateral and international meetings and a better understanding of the contacts with the public and with parliaments.
The Union for the Mediterranean Union for the Mediterranean and its further development under the auspices of the EU and its institutions has pointed out how important it is to make the process of democratisation that has increased on both sides in reality and implementation.
The dream has made an important contribution.
The Mediterranean has always been a key player in our questions, changes and plans, and it holds a key role in the EU's <unk> and <unk>
The progress that this proposal represents is also proof of the degree of <unk> innovation and commitment that the Union can face in the face of major challenges.
I congratulate and thank the European Commission, especially Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for her work and for her proposal which we consider to be balanced and <unk>
Your proposal uses our commitments and our personal interests in the best sense, it builds on the new French proposals and paves the way for the future.
The joint resolution welcomes and supports the European Parliament.
It will give its support to the interesting and ambitious project.
The challenges in this region are increasing in size and urgency.
There are major economic and political differences, serious security problems and economic inequalities.
Furthermore, the economic and political environment of the Mediterranean is becoming more complex.
Both the United States and China and Russia must be involved in the deliberations so that we must take more cautious and effective action.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wanted to respond immediately to the Commission communication.
This is because, as the Commissioner herself pointed out, we have a vested interest in the <unk> renewal and further development of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
We support the Commission's view that the European Union - on the European side - should be the institutional and political actor in the construction of the Mediterranean Union.
This can encourage our partners in the South to cooperate more with each other, which has so far been extremely difficult.
We agree that the Union's role in the Mediterranean area in economic and regional integration between the countries of the Mediterranean should be and should be implemented by some large <unk> and we also find that the examples proposed by the Commission are appropriate.
However, this requires a clear <unk>
Above all, we must avoid overlaps between the role of the Commission and the future secretariat.
As far as the revival of the partnership is concerned, we are naturally seeking to strengthen its political dimension. We are interested not only in the dialogue between governments, but also in the active role of parliaments, in the creation of the <unk> and its work and of civil society, and I would stress that the social partners have a crucial role to play in this framework.
All in all, it must be clear that the projects listed in the Commission communication must not be carried out at the expense of current projects in the fields of culture, heritage, education and audiovisual media.
In this context, we call for the Erasmus Mundus programme and a <unk> of the <unk> programme.
(FR) Madam President, welcome to the relaunch after thirteen years of the process of multilateral relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries of the Mediterranean.
Our resolution is quite correct.
There was no <unk> initiative but, on the contrary, a good and happy initiative, a new initiative, a new one, a new one.
This shows that the Barcelona Process has at least been improved, and that is what we are all trying to do.
Welcome to this <unk> Union for the <unk>
After all, it is the first time that the instrument is before us and I have no doubt that the Union will remain as a <unk> name for the Mediterranean, but I do not want to <unk>
The Union for the Mediterranean is the egg of the <unk>
The Mediterranean is a sea.
We are all <unk> others are less or less not yet - the countries in the south - but they are not yet - the countries in the south - but we must work together and, as the Commission has clearly stressed, we start with concrete projects relating to environmental pollution, energy production, job creation for young people, which is essential for the <unk>
Welcome to this parliamentary relaunch in less tangible areas on human rights, human rights and <unk>
I would, however, like to conclude by saying that there will certainly be no third <unk>
We have to succeed this time, because otherwise we would have our own interests.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the idea of the French President, within the framework of the Mediterranean Union, the countries of North Africa and the Middle East are <unk> but there has also been a great deal of talk of military <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would like to quote from <unk> 'The <unk> must be <unk>
But I am now more concerned about this development, as the European Commission also actively addresses and supported these plans.
There was a meeting between the <unk> Mr Mohammed <unk> and the Commission about 14 days ago.
Mr Barroso has been here.
An agreement has been reached between the <unk> the International Atomic Energy Agency and Euratom or the Commission, which aims to promote the spread of nuclear energy.
It is precisely those developing countries, as well as Sarkozy who are in the process of being able to take a look at them, in every way they can help to make use of nuclear energy.
I have many questions.
First of all, Commissioner, you should start with this agreement.
I have the proposal to do on this.
Why have you <unk>
Is there any justification for this <unk>
Secondly, what does Mr Solana actually say to the signing of such a <unk>
I cannot imagine that this agreement can have a European approval at all in the light of the conflict surrounding Iran, particularly in view of the conflict.
I would very much like to say that I would be very pleased if you come from the Austrian Republic of Austria, because the whole affair has taken place almost <unk>
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz will be pleased to hear that I will not speak French.
However, this does not seem to me to be entirely in favour of the initiative by President Sarkozy, who has put Europe in a position - or rather <unk> - from which it can play a crucial role in the Mediterranean.
The merit of the <unk> is to give an answer to the question of the results of the Barcelona Process, which was anything but <unk>
Whenever we ask ourselves what the Mediterranean has gained from the Barcelona Process, it can only be unsatisfactory.
Of course, there was war, there is still the <unk>
When it was decided in Barcelona in 1995 that this new European policy was to be launched in 1995, we thought that it would be possible to build peace after the conflict.
But it did not happen and it is still not so.
Europe has fallen behind and the French President's initiative has just come to our attention.
We support the Commission's initiative and the compromise that emerged from it.
We support them, but we believe that this is not yet sufficient given the role that Europe can and must play in the Mediterranean.
Some people fear and still fear that the French initiative could question European cohesion, and I do not see this danger.
There is no danger of when Europe is asked to focus more on policy and less on the market.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are holding today is of the utmost importance.
One of the keys to the future of our continent lies in our ability to prevent a deeper break over the Mediterranean in two culturally and economically <unk> parts.
Despite all the differences between the two shores of the <unk> <unk> what unites us is what unites us even more than what divides us.
That is why Mr Sarkozy's initiative is an excellent one, because it <unk> the Barcelona Process to the Barcelona Process.
As far as the method is concerned, however, I would like to make a few comments.
When France signed its European obligations in the various Treaties of Maastricht to Lisbon, what I am sorry to do is to transfer some of its responsibilities, particularly with regard to external affairs, to Community legislation.
Whether or not it likes Mr <unk> is unfortunately the world in which these treaties are <unk>
That is why I believe it is inconsistent to launch such a project under great <unk>
In reality, France no longer has the power to do so.
The only way in which we can move forward is to use all the diplomatic and human resources that France has to persuade its partners of a reform of the Barcelona Process without creating the impression that we want to call into question what has already been created.
The result of this inconsistency is evident today, because it is no coincidence that this debate yesterday when the Council could have taken part in this morning has been moved to this morning, as only the Commission is represented.
Of course, it must be more than just a sign of <unk> the Commission does not intend to leave this dossier out of hand.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased today that the <unk> Union is at the top of the European agenda.
The Commission's diagnosis seems to be right.
On the basis of the achievements of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation that has been initiated since 1995, it has created a new dynamic to overcome shortcomings and shortcomings.
In this sense, I welcome the fact that the objectives mentioned here are characterised by the principles of equality and equality, which are at the heart of the Union project for the Mediterranean.
The regional projects to be carried out in this context will also be clearer and more visible and, above all, closer to the citizens.
<unk> on the part of the peoples will be the guarantee of a strong partnership and strengthening regional cooperation in the Southern Mediterranean.
In pursuing this objective, the official role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will be crucial.
This assembly is finally recognised officially as parliamentary support for the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
Finally, I would like to emphasise the governance of this project.
Our objective must continue to be to strengthen political relations, sharing responsibility for equality and meeting the meetings between the <unk>
We must not water down the political content of this project under the burden of an institutional mechanism which would certainly lead to <unk>
We must give it the means to achieve real efficiency by creating a <unk> which is the guarantee of equality and shared responsibility, and a secretariat that must be a genuine <unk> of the Union for the Mediterranean and the monitoring body for the implementation of the specific projects.
The Union for the Mediterranean is a great step forward and, as you said, Commissioner, I hope that a new era will open up with our partners, as we have a common destiny together.
(ES) Madam President, as there is a life outside the European Parliament, I assume that some of us will have the opportunity to go to cinema.
Last Sunday, I saw a film which I warmly recommend and I have no financial interest in its production or <unk> it says 'the <unk> <unk> and <unk> the political, economic, social and cultural problems of a great <unk>
In any case, in this film with a long period of almost two and a half hours, the European Union, our presence or the Barcelona Process is somehow mentioned.
Does this mean that the Barcelona Process does not exist that it is <unk>
No, we must not confuse anything.
It is not visible enough, but it contains elements of which people benefit and who have become a reference point for a foreign policy other than cooperation and equality.
The Barcelona Process is the exact opposite of the historical relationship between Europe and the southern Mediterranean.
It is not a <unk> process and is not <unk> it is about partnership in order to have a process of <unk> that must not be forgotten.
This process could not change the great momentum in the Mediterranean, but how can we expect that in little more than 10 years, a dynamic that has existed over hundreds of years <unk>
Nevertheless, it has succeeded in giving a new direction to some of these developments.
We must therefore strengthen it politically and <unk> through programmes and funding.
That is the Union for the Mediterranean.
The European Commission is clearly expressing this in its communication, and this is why this Parliament is supporting the communication and supports the will of the vast majority of European governments to more <unk> more <unk>
This is the Union for the <unk> not more structures, but the opportunity for people to have a better life thanks to cooperation between equals.
I would like to say that the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly must be the legislative body that gives democratic legitimacy to this process.
It is no coincidence that you, Mrs Rothe, as a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, are holding this sitting.
Madam President, I thank all the Members who have spoken and have been accompanied by the Barcelona Process for many years.
It is a wonderful concept that deserves success.
I particularly welcome the initiative of the President of Parliament to set up a structure within this Parliament to promote the Barcelona Process and the commitment of the French President Sarkozy to strengthen the process with various aspects.
Today's Monday, 9 June is the day of the opening of the <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to take note of this date.
We say that our success is based on dialogue, and a successful university should offer a good example of the <unk>
I congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for offering the University of the university but I would like to ask colleagues in all committees - and the Commission and the Council - why no budget is allocated for university <unk>
We should certainly not rely on a single <unk> - in this case Slovenia - to shape the future of the university.
If we want the university to succeed, we must set a budget for the following years.
(ES) Madam President, the history of the Mediterranean is much more deeply <unk> than its <unk>
It is not necessary to come from the region, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, to understand the serious problems that the resolution unfortunately fails to mention - drugs, the economic divide between the two shores of the Mediterranean and, of course, radical Islamic fundamentalism, which is one of the biggest black holes in international politics.
Hence the importance of the situation in the Mediterranean for the stability and security of our own political project.
That is why we welcome the Commission' s communication and we welcome its willingness to fulfil the mandate of the European <unk> we welcome the realism with which it puts things in the right light, and we welcome its common sense with which it highlights the more and more multilateral nature of initiatives that will be reflected in this new initiative which will be reflected in the Barcelona Process.
I would like to point out, Madam President, that I disagree with some of the criticisms made in this debate.
I believe that the European Union and the Commission, if necessary, give precedence to the figures and it is clear that the European Union has always tried to defend the principles we believe in its founding countries.
However, Madam President, the fact is that we often need to move away from the <unk> and the noble principles of the <unk> in order to ensure credibility and realism and from words to actions in the policies that we want to give a boost.
That is why, Madam President, it is very easy to criticise and to propose initiatives, but these initiatives must be weighed up against the resources provided by the Member States of the European Union to implement the measures.
I therefore believe, Madam President, that in the current financial perspective, we have what we have and if we do not use these funds, we will not be able to meet the demands that we as the European Union are making ourselves.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the then Mediterranean Union has caused <unk> and concerns both in Europe and in our <unk>
Clearly, this initiative could not be a purely <unk> or <unk> initiative, nor the expression of a <unk> vision of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
I welcome what the Commissioner has said this morning, the concrete proposals she has made and which will meet some of our concerns.
This joint project must be a joint dialogue based on equality and common management.
However, the <unk> relationship is an asymmetric relationship, characterised by passions and <unk>
It is quite obvious in the field of trade, both the <unk> and the <unk>
It is also important to ask whether a free trade area is to be established in 2010 or not, because it is based on relations which are often painful and complex and are now being extended by what some Conservatives want, namely the shock of the <unk> a confrontation between the Western and the eastern <unk>
So, if we have to take decisions, we must first look at this <unk> relationship and <unk>
<unk> means strengthening parliaments, especially the role of the Parliamentary Assembly of <unk> <unk> in our proposals for good <unk> rationality on the aid that can be granted for the <unk> also on the free movement of persons and on the Israeli-Palestinian question.
We should also be <unk> because, if we are not able to act <unk> we will not be able to create these <unk> and this shock of the <unk> which some people want.
Madam President, the new impetus of the Barcelona Process on the Mediterranean Union has been explained well by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and other speakers.
The Barcelona ideas are now more topical than ever.
Unfortunately, the gap between the European Union and most of the Mediterranean countries has increased.
The increasingly free trade with the European Union has not <unk> the local and foreign investments needed to improve the standard of living of our Mediterranean partners.
Much now depends on the success of the new proposed projects that are visible and tangible for ordinary citizens on both sides of the Mediterranean, and at the same time <unk> and <unk> projects such as civil protection, the consequences of climate change, drought and forest fires, the cleaning of the Mediterranean and the development of technology to make optimum use of solar energy in favour of both shores of the Mediterranean.
Joint projects for all Mediterranean countries in the north and south are one of the keys to success.
The issues of migration, social integration, justice and security offer both sides of the European Union benefit and <unk>
We should not forget that our partners are now transit transit for sub-Saharan Africa from sub-Saharan Africa.
The question of funding remains open, especially in an ambitious project such as this.
The more tangible and visible the benefits of this project are, the sooner the Member States will be prepared to make money available.
Mr President, Commissioner, if only <unk> I would like to congratulate President Sarkozy on this.
In fact, with his <unk> around the <unk> he has indeed given the Barcelona Process that has already existed since 1995, and has given rise to a new debate around our southern <unk>
Well, in the <unk> I note that the original idea of February 2007 was the same as <unk>
First of all, a possible alternative to the accession of Turkey to the European Union with the Rome Declaration in December 2007 was effectively launched by Spain and Italy.
Then Chancellor Merkel was in favour of developing the <unk> within the existing <unk>
The Commission has also <unk> ambitious plans for the secretariat and the leadership of the project.
It is clear that in the European Union there is no <unk>
(MT) We need this <unk> we need new momentum for the Mediterranean region, which is so important for the Mediterranean region as for Europe.
Perhaps the biggest weakness in the Barcelona Process was that our neighbouring countries in the central Mediterranean always had the impression that it was a European process that was <unk> and where there was a sense of equality and participation.
At the summit on 13 July, we must ensure that this new Union for the Mediterranean is based on genuine membership and true equality.
We should build them on separate structures and not impose our expectations.
Of course, this means that both sides have both rights and obligations.
We welcome this proposal with a mixture of scepticism and hope.
I hope that the hope of <unk>
(PT) The Barcelona Process is only because our relations with the South affect a number of key political issues in Europe.
These include energy, the fight against terrorism, demographics and immigration, economic development and the fight against crime.
But we must recognise that the Barcelona Process itself is not a success.
The great success of Europe is to push ahead with reforms in candidate countries.
But the countries in the Mediterranean countries cannot join the European Union, but in some cases our neighbours are our neighbours.
The question therefore arises as to how we need to change our strategy for relaunching the process so that the new Union for the Mediterranean is not just another fine idea.
Do we believe that further progress is being made to promote certain investments in the context of truly open markets?
Do we believe in the broadest possible access to <unk>
Are we in favour of the level of aid being dependent on the quality of the reforms carried out?
I think that the problems of the Mediterranean are also our problems.
We must bear in mind that, if we fail to understand what went wrong in Barcelona, we will not succeed in bringing new momentum to relations with our partners in the south.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, not only to see this Barcelona Process as a purely economic process.
If Europe needs energy, it is directed at Africa to be able to use sun and <unk>
Is this not too <unk>
Should we not start this process by taking action in the field of culture.
We will be dealing with very different countries, proud countries, countries that have a history and a great culture.
Should we not work towards social cohesion by means of a thorough cultural <unk>
In no document, I found a reference to the <unk> which has been trying to achieve this cooperation for some years.
I would very much like to see the project of a university university.
(BG) Mr President,
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the question of the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean strategy is of strategic importance.
This is a process of common future development, which is not just about the increased influence of the European Union and economic cooperation, but also of good neighbours.
The Mediterranean region, with its rich cultural and historical heritage, and its current political and economic weight play a particularly important role.
I regard this as a process, a step towards a more global role in the EU as a whole, and not for the <unk>
At the same time, the EU strategy should be linked to the development of EU policy with the eastern dimension of the EU's strategic projects.
The Black Sea region has always been linked to the Mediterranean, which is why both sides should be treated on an equal footing.
Only in this way can we achieve new efficiency, a greater influence of European Union policy and values.
In this way, EU policy is given a new added value.
Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that the plan to build motorways will not solve the most urgent problems of the Mediterranean, unless it is intended to persuade President Sarkozy to <unk> a <unk> motorway from France to Turkey.
Commissioner, I was disappointed by your opening speech because you did not address the major political problems of the Mediterranean.
I am referring to Israel's occupation of Cyprus by the occupying force, the occupation of Cyprus by the occupying force, which is continuing in this 21st century by Spain, which enjoys two colonies in Morocco, and the two British colonies in Cyprus and, I know, a British colony in Spain.
Until you address these serious problems, we will not be able to translate the theoretical plans for a Mediterranean Union into action.
(PL) Mr President, Europe is basically with two <unk>
The Mediterranean is the Mediterranean that we are discussing now.
The other is the dimension of the eastern neighbours, some of which have fled Poland, such as Ukraine, Belarus or Russia.
The Eastern Dimension also includes countries in the Caucasus such as Georgia or Armenia.
It is good and right that today, 13 years after Barcelona, we deal with the important dimension of the Mediterranean in our European policy.
However, it must be stressed that this is only part of a wider whole.
The policy for the Mediterranean countries is necessary and must be renewed but it is only one element in the Union's general foreign policy which should take an important place in our policy towards future members.
Frankly, I do not believe that one of the Mediterranean countries that we are discussing today will join the EU.
Ukraine, Georgia or Armenia will certainly become members.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, what I wanted to say is that we need to be <unk> in order to <unk>
I am therefore interested in whether there really is this interest on the other shores of the Mediterranean.
Because, if you observe the <unk> <unk> which the French Government <unk> in order to bring the Heads of State or Government to Paris on 13 July, we wonder whether there really is mutual agreement on the other.
I would like to say that your new project is really interesting.
The European Union has been built on coal and steel.
If we are to propose our partners to build a project for the 21st century, which is based on the <unk> renewable energies, the restoration of a completely damaged environment in order to build the Mediterranean, then we can support this project.
Where is the coherence, Mrs <unk>
What can we respond to this <unk> of Mr Sarkozy, who is urging Algeria today to negotiate with the Presidency an agreement on the establishment of a nuclear power <unk>
I believe that there is a contradiction between the Council and the Commission.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Matsakis is right: I broadly agree with what he said.
There have always been difficulties and problems for the coastal states of the <unk> as it was 2 000 years ago.
But what Mr Watson, chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, is also saying is right: we need to learn if we want to take action.
I therefore call on the new Italian Government under Prime Minister Berlusconi to listen to the requests and <unk> of Colonel Gaddafi who, when it came to the problem of the Bulgarian nurses, wanted to make it absolutely right without seeing everything that is behind it.
He had repeatedly asked Italy to build a motorway in his country.
A motorway would benefit not only President Gaddafi but also all the inhabitants of <unk> so let us show our goodwill and do something positive for the Mediterranean as a whole.
(PL) Mr President, the Mediterranean and the Middle East are strategically important regions from the European Union.
There is no doubt that there must be peace and economic stability based on democratic principles, solidarity and cooperation if we want to tackle the common challenges.
It is also necessary to consolidate and promote the Barcelona Process in order to build a strong partnership in the area of foreign and security policy, as well as in the fight against terrorism.
The Euro-Mediterranean partnership must not confine itself solely to economic and trade issues.
It should be supplemented by greater regional cooperation, closer social integration and cooperation on environmental protection.
It also needs to be said that politics should promote the social role of women in the Mediterranean by promoting gender equality.
Respect for customs and <unk> must not affect fundamental women's rights.
Finally, I welcome the Commission's proposal on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
The role and democratic legitimacy of the <unk> should be strengthened.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will continue to speak French.
Perhaps Mr Schulz is not my opinion, but I believe that President Sarkozy has given the impetus to the Union for the Mediterranean.
I therefore believe that this is a time for me to continue to use this language.
First of all, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that this debate or this question cannot be ignored.
Everyone has something to say about this, and that is very important.
I believe that peace in the Mediterranean may prevail.
It is also true that there is still a gap between the two sides, which is on the one hand but which is still there.
We must also take into account the progress already made, macroeconomic stability, lower inflation, better developed human rights than before.
Of course, much remains to be done.
On the other hand, there is a huge need for reforms and they must be made more rapid and <unk>
Moreover, the issue of trade and investment is absolutely essential.
As Mr Wurtz said, I do not believe that the Barcelona Process is dead.
No, I have always said that I think it was very difficult to implement because of the existing political problems, and that is also true.
When there was talk of political problems, it was always a question of <unk>
Unfortunately, these problems will continue to exist, even if we try - and I agree - to resolve these issues with absolutely specific projects.
I am convinced that this is a good idea, and I believe that we are dealing with them in pragmatic and concrete ways and, of course, with all sides.
With regard to free trade and free trade agreements, I must say that the year 2010 is the first year in which these agreements could be implemented.
Of course, we do not have free trade agreements.
As far as agriculture is concerned, we are in the process of <unk> but this is very complicated, even for the other side, because it is not just a question of giving something but also to receiving something.
These negotiations are always difficult.
Free trade agreements with Tunisia and Israel will enter into force by 2010.
An agreement is currently being negotiated with Morocco, but there is still much to be done.
The last country affected will be Egypt.
You see, therefore, that things are moving very slowly, not because of the process but because of the countries themselves, who do not want to go faster.
I believe that this should be emphasised at all.
Despite everything, this new idea is a good idea, an opportunity and I hope that the partners will use them.
It is also true, Mrs <unk> that the partners must naturally be willing to <unk>
That is why the Commission has discussed with each of them to ensure that their proposals reflect their concerns and their positions.
As far as human rights are concerned, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I too would have done nothing if there were no human rights there.
But the Barcelona Process remains <unk> that is the idea.
The institutions are also affected.
In principle, the institutions play a part in this, and this also applies to <unk>
It is of course the case that the <unk> is <unk> and with a new Presidency and a new director that would have to be strengthened.
These things are not lost.
The neighbourhood policy that I have mentioned is of course still the subject of bilateral policy, because this policy is of course trying to strengthen and promote reforms with its <unk>
So do not believe that this is the case.
It really is the <unk> that the projects that we have already implemented.
The <unk> in <unk> first of all, I think that is an excellent idea of the Slovenian Presidency.
I am going to travel personally to the <unk> on which I was invited and I would like to be.
As far as funding is concerned, as it is a Slovenian idea, I believe that it is normal for the <unk> to contribute to what they will do by contributing EUR 1 million.
I have also asked for something to be done, so I have tried to make some of the funds that are already <unk> in principle.
That is not so easy.
I have found a million and I will put it into the project.
But there are other instruments, and I have informed the Presidency of that.
Firstly, there is the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, for which only the allocation needs to be reviewed, and which is intended for Slovenia, and secondly, there are also funds for research and education.
So resources are available.
You also know very well that, of course, the <unk> will remain.
That is something new and we want to strengthen it.
Let me also briefly say something about culture.
I think someone said that Robert Schuman said that if the European Union were to start again, it would have to start with culture.
This is true, but in view of so much poverty and so illiteracy we must also do something different, and I can repeat what I said for human rights: all the programmes concerned remain in question and that is not a few <unk>
I would now like to say a few words about the secretariat, because that was a very specific question.
In the light of the positions expressed in our communication, we have reached the conclusion that it is useful to call on the secretariat to fulfil its mission to formulate joint proposals for initiatives that will then have to be adopted by political bodies and the need to ensure the necessary control of the EU Heads of State and Government.
The secretariat could also be a separate legal entity and have an autonomous status.
The procedures must be clarified.
Finally, I would like to say a few words on the nuclear issue.
The memorandum of understanding signed by our President with the <unk> of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna concerns security and security.
Personally, it is in favour and everyone should be it because it is not possible for the Member States to choose their energy sources.
However, each country has the right, as you have said, to certain reservations regarding nuclear energy, and you know that we too have that too.
After all, we must give the other countries the opportunity to do what they want.
In this case, security and security are fundamental and this is based on the principle of solidarity.
Excuse me, Mr President, but as I said at the beginning, this debate has not been <unk>
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
It is a great pleasure to hear statements from the Council and the Commission regarding the Barcelona Process and the proposal for a Mediterranean Union.
The latter will be launched in Paris on 13 July during the French Presidency.
The Malta Government has drawn up a <unk> on the aforementioned declarations.
I fully support the proposals concerning the Mediterranean Union.
Given that it is important not to double the efforts and energies of <unk> the proposal on the activities at sea is called <unk>
Malta has offered to set up a secretariat to organise such proposals, and I support this offer, not only because of the unique geographical location of the island in the Mediterranean, but also because we have the necessary infrastructure, staff and experience in order to create such a Institute.
I would like to conclude by mentioning that a Labour Government was a Labour government that managed to draw the world's attention to the importance of the Mediterranean and the need for cooperation between countries on the northern and southern shores of this sea.
I welcome the establishment of a Union for the Mediterranean which will help to improve and enhance relations with our Mediterranean partners and to promote the mutual knowledge of growth, employment and education in the EU and in the twelve countries involved.
The promotion of peace and democracy, <unk> <unk> <unk> these were the key points in the neighbourhood policy of my country to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> in this respect.
The Union for the Mediterranean will help to promote the realisation of cross-border projects that are important for the entire region and serve to improve the motorways of the sea against marine pollution, to create a better integrated energy market and to develop new renewable technologies.
The Union for the Mediterranean must help to promote democracy and resolve conflicts that still destabilise the Middle East and Western Sahara, and it must also do so through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly which must be fully involved.
Food hygiene (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 on the elimination of discrimination in the area of <unk> and <unk> under Article <unk> of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Regulation (EC) No <unk> of the European Parliament and of the Council on food hygiene - <unk> -.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we are making a contribution to the Millennium Round.
It has been possible to make it clear without any threat or <unk> of high environmental standards that it is possible and should be possible to make it easier for the implementation of <unk> particularly for small businesses.
The main priority - and the Commissioner has pointed this out - is the <unk> which relate to <unk>
I would like to remind you that these possibilities have already been available in the <unk> existing since 2006.
However, we have seen that the paradigm shift in the <unk> sector has also been difficulties in implementation.
It has always been the declared objective of Parliament and the Commission to preserve the diversity of food production in the European Union.
This also means, for example, that small <unk> still have their raison d'être and should have their raison d'être in future.
However, the information that we have from the countries shows that this is at risk in some regions.
I therefore consider it necessary to point out that the possible flexibility in the regulations is also being applied.
This is something that we have highlighted clearly and clearly in this report.
In order to maintain flexibility, it is also part of the considerations that we are referring to small and medium-sized enterprises.
This makes it possible that, for example, companies that have not only 10 employees but perhaps eleven staff will benefit from a <unk> and will also be able to make a request for simplification in bureaucracy, of course, only if they can prove that they are controlling the risk or there is no risk.
It has also been emphasised very clearly that the <unk> is responsible for proving that it is dominated by the risk or that it can guarantee a <unk> sound food production.
In 2006, we set in place <unk> which will apply in the <unk>
That is why the amendment by Mrs Corbey is incomprehensible to the Member States that it should be left to the Member States to make it easier for the implementation of environmental legislation.
This would not only create new <unk> situations that we would actually like to abolish with the regulation - that is to say, no distortion of competition - but we also disagree with the intention of the regulation.
So in the regulation we are opposed to the regulation.
Surely that is not the intention.
The text adopted in committee is certainly also acceptable but we explicitly support the possibility of facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises.
Similarly, the strong involvement of the official authority does not comply with the principles of the regulation.
The regulations clearly stated that the <unk> of <unk> work is responsible and that it is necessary to prove that they have the risk.
Time and again there are objections that in 2009 there is a review of the regulations and that no measures are needed at this stage.
I would like to contradict that.
In 2009, all food production products must be permitted.
It is precisely within this framework programme that problems arise.
This leads to discussions and threatens the existence of the small <unk> mentioned earlier.
That was also the starting point of the Commission's intention to present a proposal here.
That is why it is important for the European Parliament to send out a signal now and clearly express its intention in the <unk>
This signal is primarily directed at the <unk> and official controls.
The European Parliament has always been aware of the reduction in red tape, and it should now also be expressed by <unk>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I will not need my two minutes and I would just like to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs has found Article 95 as a legal basis for the first part and Articles 95 and 175 as the basis for the second part.
The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be taken into account when approving the decision.
Thank you, Mr President.
For the European citizens of the 21st century, health and the consumption of quality food are of paramount importance.
Our task as Members of the European Parliament is to ensure that this is guaranteed, but we need legislation and procedures such as <unk> to protect consumers' interests.
It is equally important, however, that we do not <unk> and our lives are <unk> because that would not be the quality of life, but bureaucracy.
I believe that this compromise proposal is a good one.
Experience so far has shown that in many cases the current <unk> are <unk>
Moreover, they cannot always be applied in the <unk> and <unk> as they require the conditions and methods of the food industry.
Nevertheless, the new Member States, including Hungary, have fully implemented and have gone even further.
Our companies have suffered and many have abandoned their centuries-old traditions and procedures, but this cannot be our objective, so we must make changes.
First of all, it must be stressed that restaurants are not <unk> they must not be asked to comply with the same rules as this is detrimental to quality and tradition.
We should not forget that there was <unk> before the <unk>
We must reduce the excessive <unk>
I support the call for only micro-enterprises and SMEs to be excluded from <unk> which are capable of monitoring food hygiene regulations.
I regret that micro-enterprises are <unk> but the exemption for SMEs is hidden in the text.
This must be stated clearly and clearly.
Last but not least, the system must be more flexible than before.
The competent national authority should decide what common sense is in the case of common sense.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
.
Better regulation - who did this not?
Commissioner <unk> efforts to reduce bureaucracy are very much in line with my group.
We must do everything we can to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
As far as his proposals on food hygiene are concerned, I have done the work and made enquiries in the Netherlands, and my colleagues have done the same in their countries: what is the <unk> <unk> and <unk> throughout Europe?
From Sweden we have already heard from the problem that the cake is <unk>
The Netherlands has received complaints about rules that have to be followed by <unk> and <unk>
However, in both countries it turned out that the <unk> were not the cause of the problem.
However, other reports are also <unk> from small shops in the United Kingdom, which have made considerable efforts over the last two years to use the <unk> and have been proud of the full success.
Does Parliament have to <unk> and explain that everything is not necessary?
That brings us to the next point.
During the last parliamentary term, we worked hard to reform the general food law.
This has been necessary because of deficiencies in food safety and a number of difficult <unk>
The core of general food law is that responsibility for food safety rests with the manufacturer.
The public authorities have a <unk>
This <unk> will be <unk> if certain companies are granted exemptions on the basis of <unk> because that would be the responsibility of the public authorities, which would actually mean a step backwards.
In addition, such a step would be unnecessary because - as has now become apparent - implementation in most Member States is working smoothly.
The small businesses in the EU Member States have already taken their house and are working with workable <unk>
We must not forget two things.
Firstly, the general package of measures that we want to change today has replaced a whole host of rules.
In 2004, Parliament, and in particular the PSE Group, had set up the fight against excessive bureaucracy.
Small companies can already demand flexibility under the current rules.
Secondly, a review is already planned for 2009.
If serious problems arise they can be resolved in 2009, in other words next year.
<unk> - our group is not convinced that it is necessary at this stage without a thorough assessment of hasty changes.
However, since we do not want to abandon small businesses, we have tabled an amendment to leave the decision to the Member States.
If there are acute problems in one Member State, this state can decide whether exceptions are possible.
This would be entirely in line with the regulation, Mr Schnellhardt, and would also be extremely pragmatic and <unk>
I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 12.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work he has put into this report.
This proposal aims to remove bureaucratic obstacles to <unk>
The <unk> is of course <unk> small businesses from the basic obligations of the <unk> <unk> without any compromise on food hygiene and consumer health and safety.
This initiative appeared necessary because companies with fewer than 10 workers whose activities mainly relate to the sale of food are severely affected by the complicated bureaucratic constraints of the <unk> in many cases so much that they must inevitably be <unk>
Such an objective is fully in line with our express desire to support small businesses in their <unk> and, in most cases, to support unfair trade practices against big companies.
This objective did not appear to have the support of the rapporteur or the Council in some parts of our deliberations.
It has been the most important objective - and it is still apparently still - exemptions and flexibility for all companies, large and small, to allow them to be allowed to operate.
This may be right at first sight and in theory but in practice it is more than unfair to small businesses and <unk> the actual purpose of this legislation, which should of course be aid to small businesses.
Some may argue that this is favour and unfair competition.
From a purely legal and simplified theoretical point of view, they may also have right to do so, but it is the same for fairness and long-term planning as if a <unk> and a small child were put into a <unk> and should fight against each other.
Our philosophy is that the small and weak countries need some privileges in certain circumstances.
Otherwise, our free internal market will become a fatal <unk> in which large fish will first and foremost become the small and then probably mutually <unk>
This is reflected in our <unk>
I urge you to vote in favour of the protection of small businesses in Europe.
.
Mr <unk> report contains a number of important amendments to the Commission's proposals.
Some of them relate to the differences between Regulation No <unk> of the European Parliament and of the Council on food hygiene and Regulation No 11. The proposal aims at greater flexibility for the competent authorities in dealing with food hygiene and simplifying procedures, and both local and regional companies are particularly important.
The implementation of the regulation requires cooperation between supervisory authorities at the various levels of the market, ongoing monitoring of this cooperation and appropriate support from the Commission, such as the exchange of best practices.
The regulation will have a positive effect on the market - if the rapporteur's amendments are adopted - and that is why we support them.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, Europeans have a right to safe food.
I believe that this should be the main thrust of the debate and the main premise of EU policy.
It is, of course, essential to ensure that the citizens are put in place as little as possible by unnecessary bureaucratic rules, but now we can already exclude micro-enterprises from the most complex <unk>
<unk> or <unk> for <unk> are not affected and other companies must only ensure proper hygiene in the future.
The granting of new exceptions except for micro-enterprises is therefore not necessary, and it would be completely absurd to increase the number of <unk> or to make the rules less specific, as the rapporteur clearly points out on some points.
Like the consumer organisations, I strongly recommend that this should be done.
(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his report, which deals with two different issues for which different procedures apply.
As food hygiene is subject to the codecision procedure, this procedure will inevitably apply to the area of prices and transport conditions for which only the consultation process applies.
I agree with the request that the requirements for food safety in the individual Member States should not or should not be <unk>
However, here we come to the question of imports of the European Union from third countries where the food is heavily associated with pesticides.
We live in a polluted environment which is detrimental to human health.
We must therefore do everything we can to prevent unhealthy food from damaging our health.
We must begin to examine foodstuffs whose ingredients and animal and vegetable raw materials are to be tested on <unk> <unk> safety and biological values.
We must pay attention to identification or possible counterfeiting.
We need to review food on foreign substances and focus on everyday consumption, for example phthalates in toys that are not used every day.
Slovak producers are often criticised with regard to food hygiene.
However, I must point out that Slovakia has far stricter rules than the 15 old Member States.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent <unk> at first sight it seems to be a simple matter, but when you listen to our fellow Members, this is not the case.
It should be the case for everyone to be able to do the best of the business of each company, but the road to this goal must not, of course, be the same for all companies.
I consider that the competent authorities in the individual Member States are actually making use of the flexibility already provided for in the current regulation, and of course certain <unk> of a highly complex <unk> <unk> of course, provided that the same safety standards can be proven and guaranteed in the case of hygiene.
I believe that this is perfectly possible by complying with best practice in a number of countries which have already been developed in a number of countries.
However, I would like to ask the Commissioner - if he could listen to me for a moment - because I would like to ask him in conversation with our rapporteur if he could clarify some points.
He stressed that all the <unk> regardless of their size, would fall under the regulation.
However, I would like to hear from him once again whether he really believes that this report requires more flexibility not only for <unk> but also for a wider range of <unk>
Secondly, the Commissioner has just said that the proposal will not lead to an additional burden on the authorities, but for companies there may be additional burdens.
My question is therefore whether the necessary evidence of companies can actually be provided on the basis of sectoral <unk> so that it does not involve any additional bureaucratic burdens.
- (RO) The report stresses the need to reduce bureaucracy in the two areas.
Regulation No 11 on the elimination of discrimination in the field of <unk> and <unk> obliges <unk> to carry out <unk> which include the <unk> routes and border crossings.
The proposal in the field of transport aims to reduce certain commitments to provide statistics for the <unk>
With regard to Regulation (EC) No <unk> on the hygiene of food products, I would like to support the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, which allows the competent authorities to exempt <unk> from the implementation of one or more of the measures imposed on them, provided that these authorities can prove that either there are no dangers which must be avoided or that <unk> risks by implementing general and specific hygiene rules are properly monitored and regularly monitored.
This relates to <unk> <unk> fruit and vegetables and, most importantly, to <unk>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food and hygiene are part of the <unk> there is no doubt about that.
Every one of them has <unk>
On the other hand, too much caution and too strict regulation does not lead to a large number of <unk> products.
In the case of doubt, a small producer makes his loading <unk> because he cannot pay the additional employees who do not pay <unk> <unk> but <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> must not have a book on whether he has <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
If that is not the case, then the <unk> the guests in any case.
In this respect, responsible legislation is in excessive <unk> which more harm than good.
That is why I am very much in favour of facilitating the bureaucratic burden on entrepreneurs, especially small entrepreneurs who are more difficult to deal with this burden than companies.
I would like to see the <unk> awareness of the concern of small businesses in particular in the environmental and consumer protection policy is transferred to other <unk> which we are discussing here.
Mr President, we have opted for a system whereby every company that produces food is processed or <unk> and has to be constantly and consistently monitored and <unk> every single <unk>
While we are debating whether food hygiene is guaranteed, consumers are contaminated by BSE, <unk> olive oil, olive oil, olive oil and <unk> wine.
The fact that more and more genetically modified foods are being found in the EU, although they are rejected by 70% of the European population, does not contribute to building trust.
That is why the decision to be taken today is to be carefully thought and it is to ensure that the health of our citizens is not sacrificed in any way in the run-up to the <unk> before the <unk>
We cannot demand compliance with stricter rules from our domestic producers and then allow the import of food that is not produced according to the same <unk> requirements, which will also lead to competitive competitive advantages.
At some point, local producers would also be calling for exemptions for exemptions and that is certainly right.
Mr President, the purpose of this proposal is to remove bureaucratic barriers for small businesses.
The proposal came from the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry as part of the 'better <unk> initiative.
While I welcome the idea of reducing the bureaucratic obstacles to small businesses, the proposal initially found a little <unk> (Mr Schnellhardt then <unk> him very well, since he has allowed some companies, such as mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> who must be considered under <unk> not to apply all the hygiene rules.
In the <unk> itself, it is clear that companies that do not have to apply the whole of the Schengen system can deviate from this with permission from the competent authorities.
The problem seems to be that authorities in some Member States do not exploit their <unk> and in some regions of the EU even small <unk> and even <unk> <unk> have to apply the complete <unk>
In my opinion, the problem is not the legislation itself, but the application of actual legislation.
(HU) I think that Mr <unk> efforts should be given full support to SMEs, and I would also like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for that.
Food safety is of crucial importance in the European Union, but we should regulate and monitor it.
People often feel that excessive regulation by the EU is helping multinationals and not SMEs.
Mr Verheugen is right in saying that the national regulatory authorities will continue to tighten up the situation and that is how small and medium-sized enterprises will be subjected to unnecessary control and the provisions will be in a <unk> and <unk> manner, while we do not dare to take real action against multinational companies that represent a stronger lobby.
Unfortunately, this report no longer supports the small <unk> and <unk> which have been forced to stop their production, but I believe that this report should be fully supported.
(PL) Mr President, I support the Commission's proposal.
It can survive more small businesses, small business and service providers if the bureaucratic obstacles are removed.
This is therefore in the interests of small entrepreneurs, their employees and consumers.
So as long as the criteria of the precautionary principle and the hygiene rules are adhered to in the food production and services sector, it makes sense to help the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> which are all the family farms.
The effects of these changes should be kept regularly monitored later.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
.
Today we are not talking about more or less hygiene, we talk about <unk> about reducing red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises.
That is why it is clear that the question needs to be raised again and clearly in the area of <unk> is it a matter for all companies, whether large or small, regardless of who is responsible and <unk>
In companies which sell their goods mainly and directly to the end users, such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and I also take on board the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in which the <unk> of entrepreneurs themselves is known as a point of contact and often also present, must certainly be treated according to other standards than in large companies.
It is about cutting red tape and about <unk>
I think we should use subsidiarity very well, but not by demanding ways of different approaches to the individual Member States, but we must have <unk>
I therefore support the Commission proposal and the report by Mr <unk>
(FR) Mr President, nobody denies the need to create a procedure based on risk analysis and critical <unk>
Everyone is pleased that the European Union is proposing legislation on food legislation at Community level in order to ensure the best possible safety for our fellow citizens.
However, we need to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, especially for small and micro-enterprises and efficiency, without any reduction in the targets relating to food.
Do we therefore need to be <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
Of course not.
As a representative of the <unk> <unk> region in Parliament, I am well aware of the <unk> of all the <unk> in my region by small and medium-sized enterprises.
<unk> are still necessary for the <unk>
They will be <unk> milk - at least some of them - and contribute to the highest standards of food safety.
If the regulatory procedures were <unk> this would be to the detriment of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I therefore call on the vote to vote in favour of Amendment No 12, which makes it more flexible.
At a time when respect for cultural diversity is required, I believe it is essential ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Member of the Commission.
Let me make it clear once again that this is not about changing the existing hygiene rules for <unk>
This is not something that is changed and there is no exception to <unk>
Everyone must also take account of our hygiene rules for food in the future.
We are talking about something quite different.
We are talking about whether the exceptionally complicated and bureaucratic rules that we have today will have to be followed by all companies when they can prove at the first stage of the procedure that there is no risk whatsoever or that the risk is completely under control.
That is the purpose of the proposal.
The answer to my question: the proposal relates only to those companies which, at the very first stage, show that there is no risk of food hygiene or that the risks are under control.
This is, of course, a rule that will affect small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly the very small ones, because it will easily be the case that it will be easy to prove that it will be able to prove that it will be able to prove that it will be able to prove that it will be able to provide the appropriate proof.
The proposal will not lead to an additional burden on the authorities, unless the <unk> of Corbett is adopted, which means that the authorities must take action at every stage of the procedure, then we have a greater burden.
I ask you to approve the rapporteur's proposal.
It has indeed produced an improvement in the original Commission proposal.
As far as this is concerned, it is quite simple: the existing law is being applied in a way that does not reflect the intentions of the legislator, and with the amendment today we are sure that the law is applied as the legislator originally wanted.
The Commission stresses that the amendment of the directive on food products does not weaken existing hygiene rules for foodstuffs.
It simply serves to create more clarity and therefore more effective application of the existing rules on the regulation of the rules relating to <unk>
There is no difference between the existing <unk> of companies in relation to <unk>
However, the fact that these rules are more affected by these rules is more likely to be more <unk>
The change will therefore affect small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
This is reflected in a new recital <unk>
The proposal will not lead to an additional burden on the competent authorities, as the responsibility for proof of compliance with the principle of responsibility lies exclusively with the <unk>
The aim of this amendment is to remove bureaucratic barriers to companies by using existing information systems more effectively.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for the contributions that have been made.
I think that in almost all of the speeches we have been <unk> we have the will to <unk> we have the will to give small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe a relief in the implementation of <unk>
It is important that we give the amendments a majority that is best implemented and that is quite simply Amendment No 10, which we have negotiated with the Commission and representatives of the Council Presidency.
It is quite clear that we want to see what we want.
It is quite simple, based on the regulations adopted in 2006.
Here we give the official authorities and also the <unk> a procedure that makes it possible to react in the short term.
I have just pointed out in my speech that the difficulties arise in the case of the approval of companies that have to take place until 2009.
We must send out a signal.
We are in favour of <unk> we are in favour of <unk> which are not being watered down by this proposal, and we are also sending out information about what Parliament wants.
Mr Schnellhardt, congratulations on your excellent work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The controls carried out by the Hungarian authorities in the summer show that there are often certain problems with food hygiene in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
These phenomena are also known in other countries.
I share the view that we need to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, especially if the rules are to hinder small businesses in their work.
However, the scope of the legislation on <unk> must not mean that food safety is reduced.
Unlike other continents, the legislation on food safety in Europe is a <unk> excellent level.
There may be shortcomings in their implementation, but these problems must not necessarily be solved by weakening the legislation.
That is why we can only do away with the <unk> and the monitoring of food hygiene by the EU, where we can be absolutely sure that we do not do damage to it.
As the Hungarians say, it is better to fear than to <unk>
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday the Commission was following a <unk> incident in the Slovenian nuclear power plant in the Slovenian nuclear power station <unk>
This <unk> was announced after a procedure which was described as <unk> but its causes and consequences are completely confused and unclear.
That is why we call on the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency demanded by the Commission and to inform the European Parliament and the public about what has actually happened and what is happening now, because there are many rumours that are neither clear nor unambiguous.
That is why we are asking the European institutions for the necessary <unk>
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that I agree with my fellow Member.
We are dealing here with a very serious <unk> in a reactor with which there has already been problems before.
It is necessary to have a maximum of openness, not least because we know that it is not easy to get a reactor off and running.
My country is just a few kilometres away from Slovenia, which also holds the Presidency.
These were two statements and that is also enough.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on 1 June, the Commission sent out and led to the precautionary principle of the European Community for the exchange of information in radiological emergency situations, led by the precautionary principle, a public declaration on the <unk> from <unk>
This concerned the withdrawal of <unk> in the <unk> nuclear power plant in <unk>
According to the latest information from the Slovenian authorities, the reactor of the <unk> nuclear power station was completely <unk> on Wednesday 4 June at 7.30 p.m.
The relatively small <unk> <unk> within the <unk>
The Slovenian authorities have confirmed that there is no release into the environment.
The situation can be considered completely under control.
The Commission has immediately sent this information to all Member States and issued a second public declaration.
Information on the information system came from the European Community system for the exchange of information in radiological <unk>
The report calls for Member States to inform the Commission and all potentially affected Member States immediately if they want to take measures to protect the population from the consequences of a radiological or nuclear accident.
The European Community must immediately pass this communication to all Member States.
All 27 Member States and Switzerland signed the <unk> agreement.
The Commission stresses that the exchange of information on nuclear incidents for the purpose of the purpose, and the Commission is of the opinion that a concept of total transparency is the most appropriate response in nuclear <unk>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have recently received a <unk> from a <unk> for radioactivity in <unk> and this image shows that there has been an astonishing <unk> of radioactivity that has been measured and that is a day before the alarm has been triggered by the <unk>
There should be a statement on this.
That brings us to the conclusion that the Commission will take all this into account.
We now come to our normal <unk>

4. Combating corruption (
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before you - as far as possible - give your assent to the report - a brief information to you and an appeal to the Council - the Member States and the European Union want and must be more ambitious and more effective than we have been against corruption.
That is why the European Parliament has promised its support for the establishment of an EU framework for combating corruption.
This is at least unanimous in the relevant committee.
The aim of this network is to promote cooperation between the authorities in the Member States and on the other hand the exchange of information on effective strategies.
However, the <unk> which we have on the table is simply too ambitious, <unk> and therefore superfluous.
Parliament has therefore tabled some very important amendments and, as I said, unanimously adopted in committee.
First of all, OLAF, Europol and Eurojust should be an integral part of this network, that is to say binding on it.
Secondly, the network should make an annual report on activities to the European Parliament and make concrete proposals in connection with combating corruption and <unk>
Thirdly, the costs for the members of this network should be borne by the European Union so that the independence of the members of the network is guaranteed.
I should therefore like to appeal to the Council to put forward Parliament's proposals and to speed up the process of <unk> then we would have a unique opportunity to have a common European Union strategy and an appropriate instrument in the fight against corruption.
5. Community system to prevent, combat and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, fisheries are currently experiencing a serious crisis that must not only be proposed to the increase in the price of oil for those who need to be proposed in the first place, but also to the poor management of the <unk> to the overcapacity of European fishing fleets and to the growing penetration of products of illegal fishing into the European market.
This very lucrative <unk> is accelerating the destruction of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems and destabilising the whole sector that is fully affected by this unfair competition.
The European Commission's proposal and this report are therefore an essential element in ensuring a sustainable and responsible fisheries which enables European fishermen to live in their profession.
The Committee on Fisheries adopted this report unanimously.
It is a question of sending a strong signal to the Council and the Member States most affected by their responsibilities today and must take the necessary immediate and effective action.
I am counting on your determination.

rapporteur. - Mr President, we have already held this debate in Strasbourg.
That is why I do not want to go into this issue today and we have found a very good compromise between the political groups in favour of what is known as the <unk> of the social partners.
We can even say that we have improved the compromise of the social partners here in the House.
I hope that this will be a very good conclusion and broad agreement.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
Mr President, I would like to put on record that if we consider sending a fact-finding mission to Georgia in the near future, we should also consider sending a mission to Georgia to Georgia.
(PL) Mr President, I cannot support today's resolution on Georgia because I believe it is unbalanced.
The situation in the Caucasus is more complex than the present resolution.
I would also remind you that Georgia's borders are the result of the policy, the <unk> <unk> even <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk>
In addition, in the 1990s, Georgia has caused a desire for secession by its own policy with the authorities of <unk>
In addition, I cannot understand how the same Members who have recently supported the independence of Serbian Kosovo in the Caucasus are today entitled to self-determination in the Caucasus in the Caucasus.
I support the international efforts to engage in dialogue and the peace process.
Mr President, I would like to support the original amendment by my colleague, James Elles, who has proposed adding a new paragraph to the effect that the EU recognises the valuable contribution that the planned deployment of a United States <unk> in Europe can afford to protect the EU.
(NL) Mr President, the resolution on the EU-US summit of course covers a large number of different issues.
Some of the positions adopted in this resolution are totally unacceptable, but others are very welcome.
I therefore had no choice but to abstain.
However, let me add that in the present resolution a passage in the present resolution should have been incorporated into the United States that they have not been involved in a potential enlargement of the European Union.
In my view, the systematic intervention of the United States in order to call for Turkey’s unacceptable cause is unacceptable interference in a European matter.
The United States must be aware that there is a great difference between the <unk> on the one hand, and the interests of the European Union and the European peoples.
Turkey's accession to the EU is therefore not possible because it is not a European country.
In this respect, we are no longer asking for less than respect for the United States.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of compensation for the Guantánamo prisoners is an opportunity for me to remind you that there is another case of <unk> civilians and <unk> who <unk> a <unk> it concerns a Member State, even a <unk> of the European Union.
Yesterday, the <unk> in Italy decided in favour of the Italian military and police force for damages for the work they were doing during the Second World War during the Second World War.
This is a moral issue which needs to be resolved and which I would draw the attention of the President of this House on several occasions.
I also spoke in this Parliament with Chancellor Merkel about the fact that they personally agree that the problem should be resolved.
Now that the attempts by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, have finally failed to <unk> the question needs to be asked whether Germany - more than 60 years after the end of the war - wants to be able to compensate our Italian <unk>
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr <unk> warmly for his report on young farmers.
I believe that today we are living in a time when food production will be very important, and we must look at the future.
One way of looking at the future of agriculture is by young farmers.
With the reform of the common agricultural policy, we are now in favour of the health check in order to find resources that support young farmers, which are the reduction of bureaucracy and the abolition of quotas, so that young farmers can go into milk production which has always been a possibility of <unk> in the <unk>
We also need to look at a bit further, because one of the problems of young farmers is their low safety when they want to start with agriculture.
Very often, banks do not want to give them the money needed for a new start and I think that we must also look at this.
I believe that young farmers can be involved in food production and they can produce in <unk> and they can produce the kind of food that we want and are really associated with the market.
I welcome the report and look forward to supporting young farmers.
(FR) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because European agriculture will not have a future for young farmers without acceptable prospects.
For many reasons, which have to do with food safety, the supply of <unk> the environment and the preservation of our beautiful <unk> and <unk> measures, positive action must be taken to motivate young people to work in agriculture and to take up family businesses.
Above all, however, I would like to express my pleasure at the fact that my initiative in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has now focused on my initiative in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to ensure that it is important to provide information on the status of the <unk> partners of farmers.
In this context, I would like to recall that in 1997, more than ten years ago, this Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of my report on the status of spouses in agriculture.
In our resolution, we have in particular called for all the assisting spouses to be made compulsory for pensions in agriculture.
The Commission has not adopted a follow-up to this resolution.
In my own country, we have the system of compulsory <unk>
This example should be <unk> we need a framework directive to achieve this.
Mr President, I wanted to say that I abstained from this report, but not because I do not believe that young farmers need support.
I am very much in this view because young farmers are certainly facing greater problems than some other farmers.
The reason I abstained was the vote on paragraph 4, where reference has been made to the so-called new Member States.
I believe that, after almost a parliamentary term, it would be time for these so-called new Member States to call no more than a new Member State but as a correct Member State that I think has been a long time ago.
(PL) Mr President, we are living in a time of peace and stability, and we have worked hard for this since the end of the Second World War.
Today, however, we are also threatened by terrorism, regional conflicts and international crime.
In these times the European Union's task should be to <unk> peace, democracy and freedom in the world.
The EU should also contribute to ensuring stability and against humanitarian disasters and mass human rights violations.
That is the vision of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy.
We are responsible for security in the world.
Security is now more than just solving international conflicts and protecting borders.
Safety must be <unk>
We need to focus more on the areas of security that are not part of the CFSP, namely food security and energy supply.
It must be borne in mind that the desired objective can only be achieved through cooperation and the exchange of best practices.
For this to happen, the Member States must coordinate their actions with each other.
Cooperation with NATO and other regional and international organisations is also essential.
(EL) Mr President, I would ask you to take the floor because we have just voted for a large majority in favour of Greece, following the devastating forest fires last summer, from the EU's Solidarity Fund.
The European public was shocked by the horrors of the last <unk>
Today's decision by the European Parliament is a gesture of real solidarity with the regions and citizens who were so badly affected in August last year.
I would like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and also to you, ladies and gentlemen, for the interesting and quick work and the very successful meeting we have organised.
Let me make one final point, Mr President: we are perhaps the only parliament in the world that creates good news.
Today we have taken an important decision on the <unk> of Greek citizens.
Unfortunately, we were able to take this decision, for technical reasons, not on the basis of a debate.
This is regrettable, but the effectiveness of the decision is more important than anything else.
(PL) Mr President, we have the huge task of moving young people to stay in rural areas.
Moreover, too few people choose to work in agriculture or to take parental leave.
Young farmers have many difficulties at the beginning of their work.
These include a lack of suitable land, high prices, a lack of compensation for investment, expensive loans and strict rules on agricultural protection.
In Poland, almost a third of farmers are younger than 40 years.
These people are open to change, <unk> progress and innovation.
Young farmers are like other <unk> people.
They are full of <unk> and are not afraid of new challenges.
They are also very important for our future, because they depend on food safety in Europe and in the world.
They need <unk> in order to better qualify for vocational training and advice.
In addition, the financial conditions for the management of rural areas must be improved and the <unk> in the technical and social infrastructure between town and country is removed.
Above all, there must be stable financial stability mechanisms.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) Following the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No <unk> on special measures in the area of agriculture in favour of the smaller islands of the North Atlantic Sea, two <unk> <unk> and aid were set up in favour of local <unk>
In order for this regulation and these two <unk> to be applied <unk> however, certain technical points still need to be made, which is why I support the Commission's proposal and the Parish report.
in writing. - We note that Amendment No 3 contains positive measures, such as the approval of the total amount of EUR <unk> million for the abuse of their <unk> the allocation of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for Greece and <unk> the <unk> of vaccination against the <unk> in order to combat this disease and to take over 50% of the <unk> per Member State as well as the savings of the staff of the institutions.
In addition, the <unk> but also undesirable measures, such as the <unk> for a Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality and changes to the establishment plan of the European Economic and Social Court.
We welcome the criticism of the two measures mentioned in the Virrankoski report and accept - although we are opposed to Amendment No 3 - that the many positive measures that have been mentioned must be taken in this session.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the joint report by my Finnish colleagues, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä on Draft amending budget No <unk> of the European Union.
It essentially concerns the collection of revenue in relation to Microsoft and interest rates at the level of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of officials in 2007 by EUR 130 000 000 in commitment appropriations and EUR 63 950 000 in commitment appropriations for <unk> Clean Medicines <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> (European <unk> EUR <unk> million in commitment appropriations and EUR <unk> million in payment appropriations from the Seventh Framework Programme, the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund with a sum of 98 000 euros in Greece and the floods in <unk>
in writing. - (PT) This draft amending budget concerns the position of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of Greece and Slovenia.
It is a question of contributing to the serious damage caused by the population by the forest fires and flooding in these two countries.
In addition, the proposal provides for the increase in the <unk> programme for measures in the health sector as a result of the outbreak of bluetongue as a result of the outbreak of bluetongue for several Member States, including Portugal.
That is why the total funding of vaccination in 9 Member States is planned for EUR 130 million in commitment appropriations and EUR <unk> million in payment appropriations.
However, we would like to highlight the attitude of over EUR <unk> million in commitment appropriations and EUR 194 million in payment appropriations for the creation of new public-private partnerships in connection with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and <unk>
These partnerships concern the initiative for Innovative Medicines <unk> Clean <unk> the European <unk> for <unk> <unk> and the Common <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>
These initiatives need at least a public development strategy and public investment that is not dependent on private <unk>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Finnish colleague Mr Virrankoski on the draft amending budget No <unk> of the European Union.
In fact, it is only a question of ending the surplus from the 2007 financial year of EUR 1 <unk> <unk> to the 2008 budget.
For 2007, the difference between the revenue that has been achieved and the amount of expenditure that has been made shows EUR <unk> billion of EUR 4.5 billion, a surplus of EUR 4.5 billion, of which the payment appropriations of EUR 3.1 billion are <unk>
With regard to this surplus of 1.4 billion, the funds transferred from the 2006 financial year to the year 2007 are <unk> which have been cancelled in the year 2007, and the negative <unk> of 0.1% of the total amount of EUR 1.5 billion in 2007 amounts to EUR 1.5 billion.
This surplus is mainly due to <unk> expenditure of almost EUR 1.6 billion.
I regret that the allocation of this <unk> instead of automatically being returned to the Member States, has not been the subject of a political discussion in order to use the funds for financing investments such as the trans-European transport networks.
I remember the difficulties we had in getting around EUR 3.5 billion to finance the excellent Galileo project.
in writing. - (PT) This amending budget is intended to stop the surplus surplus from 2007 to the Community budget for 2008.
This surplus amounts to over EUR <unk> billion and is due to the delay in approving operational programmes of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, which should be transferred to the various Member States.
The draft also covers amounts that were not spent in 2007 under the EU's common foreign and security policy, for example the police mission in Afghanistan and the so-called civil mission in Kosovo.
With regard to the situation in Kosovo, we wish to highlight the illegal and unacceptable operation of the <unk> operation - that is to say the interference, <unk> aggression, occupation and unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, with total disregard for international law - and the current negotiations on the transfer of powers from the jurisdiction of the Kosovo Liberation Army to the European Union in the UN Security Council in the United Nations.
Finally, I would like to point out that the 2007 annual report will reduce Member States' contributions to the Community budget, as follows: EUR 300 million less for Germany, EUR <unk> million less for the United Kingdom and EUR <unk> million less for France.
This is called <unk> <unk> ...
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the report on Draft amending budget No <unk> of the European Union for the financial year 2008 <unk> - <unk> - <unk>
Mr Virrankoski has produced a thorough and thorough report.
I agree with the rapporteur that the <unk> of every financial year should be a revenue or expenditure in the budget of the subsequent financial year, in our case in the 2008 budget.
This should be done by the amending budget that the Commission has put forward.
The Conservatives have abstained from this report because it is part of the European objective to create an area of freedom, security and justice - we prefer an intergovernmental approach.
in writing. - (PT) The strategy of the European Union to prevent and combat organised crime is in favour of a comprehensive EU policy against corruption in which all the key players must actively participate.
Effective prevention and combating corruption in Europe is therefore dependent on effective and effective cooperation between the respective authorities and bodies of the Member States in order to identify ways of exchanging best practice and developing high technical standards.
I therefore support the idea of formally setting up a network of the fight against corruption with contact points in the Member States, which must be linked fully to the work of other organisations and bodies that have a fundamental role in this fight, such as OLAF (the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and Eurojust.
I also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Pirker, in particular the amendment that concerns the need for transparency and information in relation to the activities and recommendations of this network and to the Commission and the European Parliament presenting an annual report.
in writing. - (RO) I welcome the Council's decision on the network of contact points against corruption, which should improve cooperation between the authorities in the fight against corruption in the EU.
European cooperation is an essential element in the fight against corruption, especially in the new Member States, which will give non-governmental organisations and European experts the continuity of a number of significant deficits, including in the field of <unk>
The latest evaluation report by the <unk> <unk> of the States against <unk> of the Council of Europe in 2007 shows that our country has only implemented 40% of the <unk> proposed by the European institutions.
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Romanian Government in Romania to publish the failure of its programmes in the fight against corruption.
I believe that the fight against corruption should be one of the main objectives of the European Union to offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice.
The European Commission <unk> Europol and Eurojust should be part of this network.
Unfortunately, the fight against corruption in some of the new Member States, including Romania, is used as an election campaign and political weapon against the opposition.
in writing. - (PT) The establishment of a <unk> in a framework of cooperation between the various Member States with the aim of exchanging experience and best practice could be a further step in the fight against corruption in each country.
According to the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are responsible for taking measures to combat fraud and protect the Community's financial interests.
At Community level, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) must be given greater autonomy and resources.
However, we do not agree with the fact that this measure will be considered and used in order to develop the more general objective of developing the so-called <unk> of freedom, security and justice in accordance with the Hague Programme of 2005, in particular by bringing matters of justice and home affairs into the Community system into the Community system.
This process of communitisation will be promoted and promoted by the Treaty, which is now known as the <unk> of <unk> because these competences that represent the sovereignty of Member States will be deprived of this sovereignty (the national parliaments and other national <unk>
We therefore reiterate our reservations about the creation of a European judicial system, which represents a step towards creating a future European Public Prosecutor on the side of Europol, Eurojust and OLAF.
in writing. - corruption is a widespread problem, which is not a part of our society, whether in the economy, in the trade union or in <unk> and <unk> after the <unk> <unk> the newspapers are now full of the scandal in the Polish <unk>
The EU has also come up with allegations of corruption, <unk> money and <unk> <unk> into the <unk>
It is therefore a positive assessment that the <unk> <unk> is working with the efforts of all the parties involved in corruption.
Let us hope that appropriate consequences will then be set.
It is not only Bulgaria that needs to improve its fight against corruption, and the EU must also be brought to bear in this respect.
We still have a much too long way to go to complain about the way in which the EU funds are handled with inadequate controls, slow procedures, slow procedures and little <unk>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my French colleague <unk> Aubert who, according to the consultation procedure, proposes to amend the proposal for a Council regulation on a Community system to prevent, combat and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
There is an urgent need to address this issue, because illegal fishing is a serious problem throughout the world.
I fully support this initiative, which, as the rapporteur suggests, was proposed by the European Parliament in February 2007.
I support the fact that fishing vessels from third countries are prohibited from entering the ports of the Member States, port services and port services, port services and port services in these ports, except in cases of distress or higher violence.
I am in favour of the introduction of a quota system to guarantee the traceability of fisheries, provided it is not too complicated.
in writing. - (PT) Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is currently one of the biggest problems in the management of water resources.
It threatens the sustainability of stocks and the biological diversity of the seas and has serious economic consequences for fishermen who comply with the laws.
As the largest consumers and importer of fishery products, the European Commission has a special responsibility in the fight against illegal fishing, for the choice of solutions to prevent these practices from continuing and for the international community to take the necessary pressure in the same way.
The European Parliament's report contains 65 proposals for amendments which complement the Commission proposal and are directed against national interests.
It must be pointed out that a system is envisaged in the proposal to apply the Community or Community activities in the territory of the Community or in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States which have been discussed and represented fully during the Portuguese Presidency.
That is why this document deserves my support.
in writing. - (PT) The sustainability of fish stocks is a crucial factor in the long-term safeguarding of fishing activities and the socio-economic sustainability of the agricultural sector.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is threatened by this sustainability and threatens the sustainability of the sector and its <unk>
It is therefore essential to take measures to strengthen the fight against these illegal activities by strengthening the control mechanisms in each Member State.
This proposal, which complements the measures already laid down in the common fisheries policy, provides for the introduction of various provisions which are intended to curb these practices of vessels sailing under the flag of a Member State or a <unk>
That is why the proposed measures also include greater control by the Member States in their ports, with a certificate issued by the <unk> <unk> that fish have been legally caught and that vessels involved in IUU fishing are placed on a list.
However, we would like to stress that in future harmonisation of these proposals in the event of a future revision of Community law on monitoring the competences of the Member States, particularly in the case of inspections.
We also point out once again that all issues relating to penalties fall within the competence of individual Member States.
in writing. - I welcome Mrs <unk> report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
It is in the interests of all the Mediterranean countries to tackle IUU fishing and the EU must play a decisive role in this.
Nevertheless, the management of fisheries resources should be the responsibility of the <unk> and the EU must aim to reduce the CFP.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the adoption of the report by Mrs Aubert on the proposal for a Council regulation on a Community system to prevent, combat and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The report is very clear and gives a distorted picture of the problem of illegal fishing, which represents a real threat to the survival of marine resources.
It therefore seems essential to introduce a Community system to combat these practices.
in writing. - Mrs <unk> report on the Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a report which I broadly support.
I agree with many of the rapporteur's proposals.
To call for a certificate of Member States to be legally caught on their boats seems to me to be fair.
It is necessary for a Europe-wide intervention to combat illegal <unk> and my vote reflects this view.
in writing. - (FR) The fishermen in France, Spain and Italy are showing their legitimate <unk> their right to live from their work.
Moreover, farmers also say nothing else.
It has been known for a year that fuel prices are <unk> our fishermen economically.
This shock is added to the bureaucratic <unk> of our fishermen through quotas, sanctions, <unk> inspections which turn the high seas into a <unk> Soviet Union.
What is being proposed to these people, these regions, these local economies in view of the tragedy of a <unk>
<unk>
In addition to a wave of temporary aid, it is almost <unk>
Worse still, on the day when the fishermen from the Mediterranean are in Brussels in order to demand their right to life, we are discussing additional <unk> against illegal fishing.
Even the road to reduced VAT and excise duties is being denied to fishermen.
The solution would be a European <unk> for fishermen, so that they do not have the consequences of unequal treatment in the face of the public burdens caused by the <unk> and the domination of the <unk>
in writing. - <unk> unreported and unregulated fishing is an increasing problem that requires enhanced cooperation between the EU and the international community if it is to be resolved effectively.
This Commission proposal reflects a large part of the recommendations of the Committee on Fisheries, in particular the first report by Mrs Aubert on <unk>
The main elements of the proposal have my full support, including the ban on the import of fish caught by IUU fishing and the introduction of <unk> vessels to refuse the port of port when they are suspected of illegal fishing.
Until recently, the EU has focused solely on the regulation of its own fishermen and on the fact that they do not violate EU legislation while fishing has essentially been neglected.
It is very gratifying to see that Parliament and the Commission are now genuinely trying to address this problem.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by our colleague <unk> Aubert on the Community system for the prevention of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
Illegal fishing is one of the greatest threats to the sustainability of fish stocks and the biological diversity of the seas.
The Commission proposal is important so that the European Union can really play a leading role in an increasingly complex and more integrated sector.
That is why I think it is desirable that this proposal should be applied not only to third-country vessels but also to the application under the auspices of the <unk> to adopt measures that are not discriminatory and to develop a common policy in the European Union.
The importance of a <unk> which guarantees traceability and the introduction of a minimum standard for <unk> parallel sanctions and a control and control system to minimise illegal <unk> is not the hand of the <unk>
in writing. - I would like to support the Aubert report and condemn illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
in writing. - (PL) Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, unreported fishing, is a serious problem.
If the European Community wants to combat this problem effectively and actively it should take advantage of the experience of Member States that are not EU members, but have much stricter rules to combat illegal fishing.
These include countries such as Norway, Iceland and Canada.
First of all, we must take action against breaches of fishing within the Union itself.
That is a major problem.
The next step should be the support of developing countries that want to take over the programme for combating IUU fishing.
Unfortunately, these developing countries do not have sufficient financial resources for this project.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my admirable Portuguese colleague Mr Freitas who, following the consultation procedure, proposes amendments to the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of sensitive industrial products against the harmful effects of <unk> and this draft regulation is intended to implement the recommendations of the United Nations in 2006.
It is intended to apply to EU fishing vessels that are not covered by the <unk> of a regional advisory council <unk> and which therefore require a regulation on the part of the <unk>
If you have the choice between doing nothing and a <unk> I support the third route proposed by the European Union, which is based on strict regulation of fisheries with <unk> and proposes <unk> and <unk> which are defined by the regional fisheries organisations <unk> while imposing discipline which the flag states must impose on their vessels when they operate in <unk> which are not regulated by a <unk>
in writing. - (PT) Some marine ecosystems (for example <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sources, <unk> <unk> and <unk> are particularly vulnerable to the use of certain fishing gear.
This proposal aims to protect these ecosystems in <unk> particularly in areas that are not regulated by a regional <unk>
We broadly agree with the proposal and the report, but would point out that certain points of the proposal need clarification.
For example, in the definition of the term <unk> <unk> the report recommends a definition of the FAO <unk> and Agriculture Organisation <unk> in the best possible scientific knowledge of these ecosystems.
In addition, we do not believe that the various equipment in relation to the consequences of their use should be lumped together in any way but must be scientifically investigated in order to identify the possible effects on stocks and the seabed.
Last but not least, it must be stressed that the issues of inspections or checks of fishing vessels fall within the competence of the Member States, especially as new federal levels have been announced for the common fisheries policy.
in writing. - The Freitas report refers to the protection of sensitive <unk>
The <unk> is outside the <unk> of any nation or <unk> and fishing activities have been largely <unk>
Given the international nature of fisheries, it is right that the EU is doing something in this area.
This distinguishes the <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> themselves, and not the EU institutions, are the appropriate supervisory bodies.
in writing. - (FI) The <unk> is one of the most important initiatives for which the present Commission is a positive one.
This proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of endangered marine species against the harmful effects of <unk> is a necessary addition to the <unk>
When, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 a halt was made to the loss of biodiversity as an objective, 2010 was set as a deadline.
We must now express our regret that this objective will not be achieved within the next two years.
Although environmental objectives have been high on the political agenda for more than 20 years, many factors are still threatening biodiversity in the seas.
Scientific studies have shown that in spite of the high yields of the <unk> in less than ten years in which to destroy certain species.
We must bear in mind that new approaches such as those in the fisheries sector are necessary, but are <unk> little about the recovery of <unk> and that the threats to ecosystems in the <unk> are much greater.
However, this proposal for a regulation for the fishing industry is as clear as necessary.
in writing. - The protection of sensitive <unk> is essential so that future generations can also enjoy the marine environment.
in writing. - (FR) Through its vote, the European Parliament lays down strict principles for the activities of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In line with the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly of the United Nations, the Members of Parliament are putting an end to the legal vacuum that has prevented the destruction of our marine ecosystems.
I am pleased that the European Members recognise the importance of marine biodiversity as an important source of marine biodiversity and have understood that the shift of the <unk> into these <unk> is the danger that our heritage will be destroyed.
The environmental awareness of MEPs is not intended to hinder the already difficult work of our fishermen or to increase bureaucratic pressure.
In the future, fishing activities in these specific zones will be subject to the acquisition of an authorisation which will assess an assessment by the Member State if fishing does not have a significant negative effect.
The precautionary principle is also being adhered to.
The preservation of marine biodiversity can only be guaranteed if it is integrated into the other Community policies, especially the future maritime policy of the European Union.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, I welcome the Commission's objectives regarding the simplification, consolidation and clarification of trade rules and procedures.
Trade is a key instrument in the current international scenario because it serves as a means of improving the efficiency of international markets and ensuring the social and cultural progress of the nations involved.
<unk> trade agreements can guarantee political stability and provide solid foundations for more or less permanent diplomatic relations.
That is why they are becoming increasingly important in an increasingly economic world that is increasingly dominated by economic relations, which also influence cultural exchanges between peoples to prevent military conflicts and to preserve peace.
Trade is therefore an extremely important element of dialogue and an opportunity for economic and social development.
Simplifying trade means making the economic system more efficient.
Given the importance of the subject discussed, I hope that this House will shoulder its responsibility for achieving these objectives.
in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Audy calls for harmonisation of the rules of origin and <unk> to ensure the correct application of the European Union's trade policy and, above all, a coherent application in all EU countries with the aim of facilitating the lives of businesses.
This could seem logical because we have been in a customs union for more than 40 years.
However, Mr Audy calls for complete harmonisation of the procedures to be applied to a single European asylum system.
It is certainly the responsibility of the <unk> to control the <unk> and its agreement with the standards <unk> consumer protection, health, the environment and so on.
At the same time, they have a tax <unk> of course, the application of appropriate <unk> but also the collection of the <unk> which is whether you like it or not, still a national tax.
Finally, and perhaps in the <unk> region, they have a role to play and contribute to the fight against smuggling of all kinds, especially drug trafficking in close cooperation with the <unk>
It is not surprising that the rapporteur has the first function in the name of the virtues of international trade and underestimates the two others.
That is why we are voting against this report.
in writing. - I support the recommendations outlined in the report by Jean-Pierre Audy on <unk> <unk> and <unk> and procedures for the service of the <unk>
I believe that this is a very balanced report, which rightly refers to the future of the European Community strategy on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon and the <unk> of the United States' <unk> <unk>
And I agree with the rapporteur that a common position on the internal market in bananas can solve the internal difficulties of Member States that bear responsibility for implementing customs policy.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the report on efficient management and management procedures and procedures in the field of trade policy, which will ensure greater efficiency in the field of trade and cooperation between European <unk>
The European Union's market is faced with the phenomenon of counterfeiting and piracy.
The losses arising from the violation of intellectual property rights were a study of the International Federation of <unk> <unk> in 2007 in Romania to EUR 62 million.
Following the adoption of this report by the European Parliament and the preparation of a plan to combat counterfeiting and piracy at European level, these losses will be reduced.
The report welcomes the consensus of the Member States and the Commission on the negotiating mandate for an international agreement against <unk> (the trade agreements against <unk> as this agreement is of great importance for the EU's trade strategy.
Since European directives on consumer protection, especially those relating to health and safety, apply to all products on the EU market, the Commission and the Member States are called upon to take all the necessary steps to effectively monitor a high level of consumer protection.
in writing. - (PL) Every year over two billion tonnes of goods are transported across sea and airports in the EU.
Customs authorities employ over 100 million <unk>
This work protects the health and safety of the citizens of the Union.
The customs authorities are also opposed to <unk>
This <unk> and increasingly dangerous phenomenon affects not only <unk> <unk> but also medicines, <unk> and <unk>
The customs authorities are making counterfeit <unk> such as <unk>
Falsified <unk> can damage the <unk>
Fighting and preventing such practices contributes to better health protection and greater safety for citizens.
Customs controls have introduced appropriate safety checks to protect the internal market.
In close cooperation with important international trading partners, they protect international freight transport from <unk> in connection with terrorist activities.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my excellent German colleague, Reimer Böge, proposes that the Commission proposal for mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund for Slovenia and Greece, which were affected by floods or forest fires in 2007, be a total of approximately EUR 98 million, which is the subject of an amending budget adopted at the same time.
In order to avoid any delay in providing financial assistance in the event of a disaster, I support the recommendation of the report that the Commission proposes <unk> whose only subject is the mobilisation of this fund, which must not exceed a million euros in the current interinstitutional agreement.
in writing. - (PT) The serious forest fires that Greece <unk> in summer 2007 and the terrible floods in Slovenia in September 2007 justify this <unk> mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for 2007.
The annual ceiling of the fund is EUR 1 billion, which has already been mobilised by some EUR 163 million for the UK following the flooding that was caused by the floods in 2007.
An amount of EUR <unk> million is therefore still available.
The proposal adopted today provides for the allocation of almost EUR 90 million to Greece and around EUR 8 million to Slovenia.
These are <unk> measured by the damage that the populations of both countries have suffered and which are over EUR 2 billion in the case of Greece.
But there is at least one question asking for an answer. How can it be that it is only now almost a year after the disasters that these people have suffered from the <unk>
There is clearly something wrong with this.
We would like to point out that we have made proposals to speed up the procedures for mobilising this fund in order to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible and, within the framework of this fund, the special nature of natural disasters (such as drought and <unk>
in writing. - (PL) Amending budget No <unk> contains the proposal on the <unk> of the Solidarity Fund.
The previous request for the United Kingdom in favour of <unk> million (EUR <unk> and the proposal currently under discussion in favour of Greece and Slovenia <unk> 98 million <unk> together with sufficient room for manoeuvre for the second half of 2008 when we consider the annual ceiling of the Solidarity Fund of around EUR 1 billion.
Other formal requirements contained in the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 have also been met.
At the meeting in May, the Committee on External Economic Relations was able to obtain all the additional necessary information, and representatives of the countries affected by natural disasters took part.
The countries were Greece, in which forest fires were <unk> and Slovenia, which was hit by flooding.
As always in such cases, the <unk> of the EU institutions is cause for concern.
This problem has been put on the table by the <unk>
The applications of Greece and Slovenia were included in October and November 2007.
The amending budget was presented by the European Commission on 14 April 2008.
This was a shorter <unk> but it is still not satisfactory.
There is all the more reason to highlight the rapid reaction of the European Parliament and the cooperation of the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Budgets when it comes to the sympathetic examination of the proposal on aid for the countries concerned.
in writing. - I welcome the measures taken to support Greece and Slovenia following the forest fires in 2007.
The EU of EUR <unk> million for Greece and EUR <unk> million for Slovenia shows that it is trying to strengthen solidarity among its members.
I therefore voted in favour of Mr <unk> report on mobilisation of the European Union's Solidarity Fund.
in writing. - natural disasters are not only causing <unk> suffering, but we are also destroying a great deal of deaths, destroying sustainable infrastructure such as <unk> roads and <unk>
In addition to the supply and <unk> of the injured people, it is therefore also necessary to repair and eliminate the damage.
In 2002, in the face of the great <unk> we have decided to give financial resources to the victims in such cases in 2002.
Of course, it is important to ensure that the money is not used to use the funds, but it must not be allowed to prevent the payment of the same - as the Court of Auditors has said - on average 12 months.
in writing. - (PT) The general objective of the European Commission proposal is to continue the EU-wide liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets with <unk> - particularly between countries within the EU within the EU and between these and third countries, including <unk> - from 1 January 2009.
Among the many <unk> that we are opposed to is the following:
There are points that aim to limit the competence of a state in the management of passenger transport in its territory, particularly to protect this public service <unk> with the so-called service in the public interest that is in private property, but with public funding.
the removal of the term <unk> and the only reference to <unk> and <unk> which will increase the exploitation of drivers.
The <unk> of <unk> in other words, the possibility of the weekly rest periods for 12 consecutive periods of <unk> which we believe can lead to situations that endanger the safety of road users and passengers.
Just imagine what is happening in the case of stricter labour and safety standards.
We therefore voted against the proposal.
in writing. - (PL) I support Mr Grosch's report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the Schengen Information System.
The report aims to highlight the best possible solutions both for <unk> and for <unk>
Its main concern is to simplify the provisions for the <unk>
At present, access to this market is regulated by two regulations on the basis of which cross-border passenger transport has been liberalised.
In the case of cross-border <unk> there is still a clear need to facilitate the issuing of licences for the exercise of such services in all EU Member States.
The legal framework must be tightened up by combining the above-mentioned regulations, through closer cooperation and by introducing sensible provisions.
Harmonisation of documentation and procedures would significantly simplify cross-border rail transport and improve controls.
I also welcome the proposed measures for simplification in <unk> regions in <unk> regions.
The question of <unk> <unk> has also been solved well.
If such transit is carried out, the competent authorities in the Member State will only inform the Member States that authorisation has been granted by the EU Member States in question.
in writing. - (PT) The Grosch report is a series of texts on road safety and the rules in the European area.
This recast will strengthen the capacities and powers of the national authorities for the granting or withdrawal of licences for <unk> in serious infringements of Community law.
That is why the circumstances of a serious violation and conditions for imposing non-discriminatory sanctions are clarified in relation to the severity of the infringement.
In order to achieve this, the Member States will be able to obtain access to a register where the serious infringements that have been committed by <unk> are linked to the national register of these companies.
I believe that this recast will lead to greater simplification in the decision-making process and more legal certainty for this economic activity and also for companies that comply with the rules.
So can we finally hope for a genuine <unk> for <unk> which is open and <unk> and the strictest conditions for road safety.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of the report by our colleague Mathieu Grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the Schengen Information System.
I support the proposal to liberalise passenger transport in the Member States, not only to simplify the European legal framework, but also to strengthen cooperation between EU countries.
To this end, it is necessary to standardise the cards and <unk> throughout the united Europe in order to make the controls that a Member State reserves in cases where passengers are <unk> by its territory by means of its territory.
I therefore hope that the authorities of the Member States whose territory will be <unk> will be informed beforehand.
in writing. - (RO) The new amended version of the report takes account of the agreement between the social partners in relation to the reintroduction of a derogation from the 12 <unk> for mobile road transport operators who travel to cross-border road transport.
I voted in favour of Amendment No 31 which lays down the conditions for the postponement of the weekly rest period for up to 12 successive <unk> following the end of the previous weekly rest period for drivers working in cross-border <unk>
These conditions are: the <unk> <unk> must be kept at least 24 hours in another Member State or third country as the country where the service has begun and the weekly rest period must always have to be complied with from 45 hours of 45 hours by the end of the derogation and if the driving time is <unk> between 10 and 2 <unk> the vehicle must be filled with two drivers or the driving time must be reduced to three hours from 1 January 2014.
in writing. - (SV) We have voted in favour of this report.
The <unk> has caused a debate in several Member States, including Sweden.
The problem is, in most cases, not the rules itself, but their application by the national authorities.
in writing. - (EL) The EU <unk> public health to the profit of European <unk> who demand fewer checks and restrictions.
A typical example of EU policy is the recent <unk> of <unk> <unk> with disastrous consequences for health.
Instead of taking measures to increase the restrictions on <unk> <unk> the EU and the governments of the Member States only restrict the export of gas from Ukraine.
At the same time, the EU food safety directive allows the transportation of <unk> and other liquids for human consumption caused by oil and other toxic <unk>
On the pretext of reducing administrative costs for small businesses, the Commission is proposing another derogation from the food safety directive that is already inadequate.
<unk> of food are even more difficult, as large multinational companies use monopolies to hide behind it, thereby preventing them from taking responsibility while continuing to carry out dangerous and harmful activities for public health.
Access to safe food in sufficient quantities and at low prices for workers remains unlikely to be <unk> as long as there is no change to the current EU policy, which only serves the interests of multinationals and their <unk>
in writing. - (PT) I voted against the Schnellhardt report on food hygiene because I believe that the amendment proposed by the Commission to Regulation (EC) No <unk> which aims to exclude small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the food sector from the application of the <unk> and critical <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> is not currently justified because there is no evidence of specific problems in applying this procedure.
In my opinion, 2009 would be the right time to propose amendments if they are justified.
in writing. - (PT) Today, at first reading, the European Parliament adopted a report on the exemption of <unk> from the food hygiene regulation.
This exemption should apply to micro-enterprises selling food, not for supermarkets or <unk>
Experience in Portugal shows that this exemption is essential in order to protect traditional production methods and customs habits and customs and on the other hand to preserve family businesses that represent a large proportion of the workers in this sector and who have the greatest difficulties in unequal competition with large groups.
Furthermore, the creation, implementation and maintenance of procedures based on the principles of <unk> and critical <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which can be important for big business to guarantee food safety, not to large and small businesses, particularly in the <unk> and <unk>
Certainly, legislation on food must guarantee a high level of protection for people's lives and health and protect the interests of consumers, but this must not be confused with the end of traditions and attacks on the <unk> culture of a country and a region.
in writing. - (DE) EU food hygiene regulations are of great importance to all Member States.
However, they have sometimes proved to be very <unk> for small businesses.
I welcome the proposals put forward by small businesses from the rules and have therefore voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Schnellhardt because it will lead to the reduction of administrative burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises in the postal sector, in particular for micro-enterprises (e.g. <unk> for example, making it more attractive and creating new jobs.
The report includes the introduction of several amendments to small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce and sell food and which are active in regional and local markets.
These are not <unk>
In the treatment of <unk> in particular, the European Parliament was keen to ensure maximum food safety and, at the same time, to establish a workable and flexible control mechanism.
Small and medium-sized enterprises that can prove that there are no dangers in the area of food hygiene and that compliance with animal health standards is regularly controlled by the <unk>
The <unk> programme contains a critical and critical <unk>
It was developed in the USA in the <unk> years in the USA when the authority had to guarantee the <unk> safety of all food and food.
In 1992, the system was incorporated into European legislation.
In the food legislation of the Slovak Republic, the <unk> is referred to as <unk> <unk>
The drawing up of the documents is complicated, and owners of micro-enterprises are easily <unk> because of the unduly high administrative burden.
As Slovak food hygiene legislation is far more stringent than those of the 15 old Member States, it is necessary to harmonise the safety requirements throughout the EU.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the proposal from Mr Schnellhardt on <unk>
In this proposal, two different problems will be taken together: firstly, reducing administrative burdens in the area of <unk> and <unk> and, secondly, adapting the rules on the exemption of micro-enterprises from the obligations arising from the <unk> Directive, which will ensure maximum food safety and ensure a high level of protection for human and health life and consumer interests.
I agree that the <unk> would reduce the prospect of achieving these objectives, which would reduce the prospect of achieving these objectives, because these procedures will enable the interests of the <unk> to increase responsibility and guarantee equal conditions of competition and flexibility in the free movement of food and feed in the Community.
Moreover, this amendment should be extended and applied to all Member States in order to adopt clear and binding safety rules.
in writing. - (NL) Mr President, when it comes to small and medium-sized enterprises, we have to adopt rules that can be fulfilled by them.
This applies equally to hygiene rules in the transport sector.
Last year, the Commission submitted a proposal to better comply with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No <unk> which is feasible for <unk>
The amendments proposed by the Commission are very useful in that they continue to be applied to small businesses, but at the same time to relieve the bureaucratic burden and from obligations that are really not acceptable to small businesses.
On the one hand, it is regrettable that Parliament has not entirely followed the Commission.
On the other hand, I voted in favour of the final report because we managed to find a solution to a solution.
However, I regret that responsibility is being transferred to the Member States.
The Member States must now assume their responsibilities and give their small and medium-sized enterprises derogations from the strict rules of competition.
in writing. - (RO) Regulation No 11 on the elimination of discrimination in the field of <unk> and <unk> obliges <unk> to carry out <unk> which include the <unk> routes and border crossings.
The proposal in the field of transport aims to reduce certain commitments to provide statistics for the <unk>
However, with regard to this amendment, only the European Parliament was consulted.
I voted in favour of Amendment No 12 tabled by the Socialist Group on the hygiene of foodstuffs which allows the competent authorities to exempt <unk> from the introduction of one or more of the measures imposed on them, provided that these authorities can prove that either there are no dangers that need to be avoided or that <unk> risks by implementing general and specific hygiene rules are properly monitored and regularly monitored.
This relates to <unk> <unk> fruit and vegetables and, most importantly, to <unk>
I find it very regrettable that this amendment has not received the necessary majority.
in writing. - (PL) The citizens of Europe increasingly respect the quality of goods and services.
Quality is a <unk> for companies.
Quality will, among other things, be understood by an appropriate certificate of compliance with quality standards.
The standards of ISO <unk> are <unk>
The <unk> was officially published by the World Health Organisation <unk> the Codex <unk> Commission introduced it in 1993, as an important component of food production.
A properly <unk> <unk> is the best guarantee of the supply of healthy food in conjunction with the ISO <unk>
In the case of the procedure and the <unk> <unk> it is primarily a question of preventing risks throughout the food chain from ensuring the safety of food products and responding appropriately if problems arise.
in writing. - (PT) Directive <unk> prohibits the use of <unk> substances, <unk> <unk> whose <unk> and <unk> listed on the list A Annex A <unk> in other words, both for animals or animal products intended for human consumption and for <unk>
However, the two products of Annex II should be used under certain conditions.
The Commission proposes a change as follows:
<unk> from the scope of this directive, which means that bans on the use of certain substances will simply no longer apply to them and can then be dealt with by these <unk>
The <unk> <unk> which was temporarily authorised for animals to be treated in the treatment of the <unk> or <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> is now completely prohibited.
The fourth application for the use of bovine animals for cattle, <unk> sheep and goats was only approved and passed until October 2006.
This substance is considered to be carcinogenic and there are now alternatives on the market so that the use of this <unk> is superfluous and can be banned completely.
in writing. - (PT) The Commission is proposing to exempt <unk> from the scope of Council Directive <unk> so that they can deal with substances containing <unk> effects and <unk>
The purpose behind this is to reduce the suffering of pet animals, and then it will also be possible to use substances with a <unk> effect on the treatment of animals in these animals.
However, recent developments in the scientific assessment show that the use of these substances in animal production is not economically attractive to human consumption or alternative substances.
It is therefore proposed to ban the use of <unk> and its <unk> in animal production for human consumption and to put an end to the various derogations that still exist.
I would like to point out that if they are used for the <unk> they can be carcinogenic for people and that the existing derogations can finally be brought to an end because these hormones can easily be replaced by alternative substances.
These changes will guarantee a high level of protection for consumers of meat and animal by-products and, at the same time, allow treatment and treatment of pet animals.
in writing. - (PL) I support Mrs <unk> report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive <unk> on the ban on the use of certain substances with <unk> or <unk> and <unk> in animal <unk>
This report is intended to seek an optimum solution to the protection of people, i.e. consumers and animal welfare.
It also takes account of scientific research into the <unk>
In particular, I welcome the complete ban on the use of the use of <unk> with the name of <unk> in the position of animals for <unk>
Efforts to achieve a high level of food safety should be a priority, especially as the products mentioned in the report can be highly <unk>
On the other hand, the proposed amendments make it possible to deal effectively with health problems which are suffering from a <unk> or other serious diseases.
So the health of <unk> is taken into account as well as animals.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mr Markov, who was unanimously adopted in the Committee on International Trade and proposes amending the proposal for a Council regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 and the amendment of various regulations.
This proposal for a regulation is based on the 2004 guidelines on the role of the GSP in the decade 2006 to 2015, which introduced several new objectives, such as the alignment of preferences to countries that are most of the same for the developing countries, greater transparency and stability of the system of preferences and the introduction of a new specific environmental policy to promote sustainable development and good governance.
I fully support the report in its call for the European Parliament to be more involved in this legislative process which is essential for the countries that are dependent on it and which brings us back to EUR 3.5 billion a year.
in writing. - (IT) In a society that is now dominated by a globalised society, in a world where three billion people live on less than two dollars per day, and more than one billion dollars with just one dollar it is a duty of the Community institutions to promote the development of the so-called Third World through a trade policy.
In order to achieve this common goal, we need to look for appropriate resources both to improve the economic situation in developing countries and to their <unk> growing integration into the world market.
We must also take account of the purely economic factors such as market shares and other criteria such as the level of development of the beneficiaries and their commitment to the path of democracy.
In pursuit of these objectives, however, we must ensure that we do not encourage the economies of developing countries to produce a limited <unk> of products, particularly if they are goods with low added value, because this would hinder the development and economic growth of these countries.
in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Markov's report on the system of tariff preferences for developing countries is a key element in the benefits of the global economic system.
Especially for the poorest countries.
When I look at my television and look at the <unk> it seems to me that there is famine in these countries.
One of the reasons for these tragedies seems to be that we are in favour of major <unk> at the expense of the local cultures that have been able to secure the <unk>
It appears that 38 years have not changed the economic and social situation of these countries and their population.
I believe that if a system has to be adopted by its ideological <unk> it will be possible to take shape if so many people in all countries in all countries are <unk> if the inequality and poverty exacerbate the inequality and poverty, we simply have to abandon some marginal changes.
in writing. - (PT) As we have already emphasised elsewhere, the current Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is based on a logic which is in itself contradictory.
This is why development is being promoted in order to liberalise international trade by means of a model which will promote international trade, which will be regulated internationally.
This logic prevents fair international relations and aid to the development of the <unk> factors of economic <unk> countries, without which - together with the theft of foreign debt and the enforcement of the interests of large multinational companies from the US, the EU and Japan - will continue to play a <unk> and subordinate role.
Trade is a component of development, but it is far from the most important.
The GSP guarantees the sale of products from a wide variety of countries.
The GSP applies to products that are particularly important for Portugal - <unk> <unk> textiles and <unk>
Textiles and clothing are particularly affected, especially because of the existing high levels of unemployment in this sector.
These and other negative aspects must be changed so that there is no serious consequences for the national manufacturing industry, the social and economic impact.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, Russia's approach towards Georgia is simply unacceptable according to international standards.
It is obvious that Russia is using its economic influence in many EU countries to see how far it can go with its ambitions.
Russia is making every effort to block relations between Georgia and the West.
I would like to stress once again that the so-called Russian <unk> in Abkhazia must be replaced immediately by EU or <unk>
The European Union should continue to demonstrate its full support for Georgia, as has happened here in Parliament today.
In addition, the Union should systematically deepen cooperation with Georgia and introduce visa facilitation for Georgia, especially now after the democratic elections.
The resolution adopted today expresses this support for Georgian sovereignty.
I am pleased that the debate in Parliament at the beginning of May took place on the initiative of Members of Parliament and justice.
The result of this debate is today's resolution, which is an official opinion of Europe on the situation in Georgia.
in writing. - (PT) From the various aspects that could be referred to this resolution, I must above all highlight the incredible hypocrisy of those who are now expressing their full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a state while they have previously supported and supported the illegal and unacceptable <unk> of the USA, NATO and the EU against Yugoslavia.
This operation was an example of interference, <unk> aggression and occupation and reached its peak in the unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, with total disregard for international law.
Once again we see clear signs - which we reject - for interference and strengthening the presence, including military presence, the United States, NATO and the EU in this region, the <unk>
One looks at the conclusions of the recent NATO summit in Bucharest where a political commitment to Georgia's accession has been made to this offensive <unk>
One example is the demands for a <unk> European <unk> and following the fact that 'the international presence in the <unk> by sending a fact-finding mission to <unk> <unk> a mission of the EU which includes 21 Member States of NATO and where ESDP - the European Security and Defence Policy - <unk> the European pillar of NATO.
One example is the initiatives to conclude <unk> <unk> between the EU and Georgia.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adopting the resolution on the situation in Georgia.
Georgians need our support and solidarity.
Solidarity is not so badly needed when it is a good thing.
Solidarity is urgently needed if someone is in difficulties or in need.
At present, Georgians are in a <unk>
We should not only show our support but also do everything in our power to preserve this country and this people against a conflict with potentially devastating consequences.
There are many indications that Georgia and Russia were on the verge of armed conflict.
It is our duty to convince everyone involved from a peaceful and political solution.
I am convinced that even the most difficult problems will be resolved if we are to try to find compromises and make a fundamental contribution to fundamental principles.
I also hope that the international community will actively and effectively support mediation efforts and the search for a lasting and fair solution acceptable to both parties.
The situation in Georgia also makes clear how important the European Neighbourhood Policy is for our policy as a whole.
This is particularly true of the eastern dimension of neighbourhood policy.
in writing. - (FR) Our message is clear: the dangerous escalation of the conflict in this region and reaffirmed the EU's support for Georgia.
The recent developments in Georgia, and especially in Abkhazia, are worrying.
A deterioration in relations between Georgia and Russia poses the risk of negative <unk> for the whole Caucasus in the Caucasus.
I was a member of the election observation mission of 21 May 2008 in Georgia, where I was able to see the intensive efforts made by Tbilisi in its democratisation process.
This clear progress I have noted in the control of 14 polling stations in the area of <unk> must not conceal the difficulties that remain in the region.
Much remains to be done, and the EU must play a role beyond election observation by supporting a reform process in the long term.
The EU must learn lessons from the experience in the Balkans and must not remain inactive in the face of a conflict in its neighbourhood.
By voting in favour of this resolution, I appeal to the two protagonists of the conflict to refrain from further acts which could lead to an escalation of tensions.
It is important to make our efforts to restore dialogue and to persuade Russia to withdraw its troops from Abkhazia.
in writing. - British Conservatives are opposed to a large part of paragraph 6 and 8 relating to <unk>
We are fundamentally opposed to the European Security and Defence Policy and we do not believe the EU is the right organisation to do the right thing to do <unk> in distant <unk>
We are also disappointed that the NATO NATO Summit in Bucharest did not extend the invitation to Georgia, the action plan for membership.
in writing. - (SV) We abstained in the vote on recital <unk> the CFSP and the common security and defence policy will probably require additional budgetary resources in future, but we do not want to anticipate the forthcoming mid-term review of the Financial Perspective by expressing ourselves at the present time.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my esteemed Polish colleague <unk> <unk> on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy <unk> which helped strengthen the European identity and role of the European Union in the world.
I agree that the CFSP must acquire more democratic legitimacy by allowing Parliament to exercise real control over this policy, also with a single voice and <unk> the causes of the current uncertainty in Europe: the fight against climate change and sustainable development, improving stability in crisis management, crisis management and <unk> non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, <unk> promotion of human rights and civil liberties in the world.
The first geographical priority must be stability in the Western Balkans and the strengthening of dialogue with Serbia and Kosovo.
I support the idea that the European Parliament submit precise proposals for the financing and control of the future European External Action Service (EEAS).
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski on his report on the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
I agree with the rapporteur that it is not enough to talk about a common foreign policy.
We must demonstrate that the European Union is prepared to adopt a common position on key issues.
On fundamental issues such as the aggressive energy policy of Russia, the events in Kosovo or the case of Tibet, the Union has demonstrated most recently that it is still a long way from a CFSP.
As long as the European Union allows its credibility to be undermined - as in the above-mentioned cases - on the international stage, and as long as individual Member States continue to operate at bilateral level, the implementation of the CFSP remains an objective.
A further clause on the common policy will not lead us if we do not finally pull together in key issues of European interests.
in writing. - I will vote in favour of this report.
I have also voted in favour of the green amendment 7, which criticises <unk> <unk> <unk> of nuclear <unk>
I am afraid that the French foreign policy is far too <unk>
It is the rumour that France has not included any diplomatic relations with North Korea, but has nothing to do with the concern for human rights, but with the promise made in 2001 by the then South Korean Government to send a disproportionately large proportion of the <unk> to the French nuclear industry in order to build two <unk> in North Korea and North Korea should be able to produce <unk> plutonium in North Korea.
France <unk> us all less security.
in writing. - (SV) I voted against it because I reject a strengthening of the EU's common foreign policy and military power with everything that it <unk>
in writing. - I fully support Amendment No 7 by my group on the <unk> report which expresses concern over <unk> worldwide nuclear technology, which could lead to greater proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The people of Scotland have great interest in nuclear issues because the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons are stationed in our territory.
Scotland rejects the plans of the government in London to build a new generation of nuclear weapons, and I fully support the work of the Scottish Government aimed at getting these weapons.
in writing. - Mr <unk> report on the annual report on the CFSP seeks to define common values and priorities in relation to Europe's role in the world.
The Treaty of Lisbon would allow the EU to speak with a more effective and unified voice on international issues, and I welcome the fact that the report addresses the contribution of the Treaty in this area.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - British Conservatives do not wish to leave UK foreign policy in the EU.
We reject the Treaty of Lisbon, any idea of a <unk> or EU seat in the UN Security Council and any role of the EU in <unk>
We have therefore voted against the report.
Of course, we welcome opportunities in which the 27 states can speak with one voice when it is entirely compatible with the interests of British foreign policy.
We also support better coordinated humanitarian action and a tougher stance in the handling of <unk> regimes in Zimbabwe, Burma and elsewhere.
in writing. - (SV) We have abstained from the vote on all sections relating to NATO, because we come from a country that does not belong to any <unk>
As far as Amendment No 14 is concerned, we think it is factually wrong to say that the Treaty is not a military one.
Even today, EU funds are used for military operations, but not in a common European <unk>
in writing. - We are in principle voting against EU legislation and have also voted against this report as a whole.
However, there were some amendments that we could support.
We voted in favour of Amendments 10 and 12 because they oppose the militarisation of the EU.
We also oppose the militarisation of the EU.
These amendments call neither for the Commission nor for the Commission to take action, nor do they recognise the authority of the Commission or the EU.
You made simple statements which we agree with on this specific issue.
We have therefore been able to vote for these two amendments without abandoning our general position both against the report as a whole and against EU legislation in general.
in writing. - (PT) Anyone who doubts the real sense of the Treaty of Lisbon and the scope of the so-called Treaty of Lisbon has only to take the resolutions on <unk> (the European Security and Defence Policy (the Common Foreign and Security Policy <unk> which was adopted by the majority of this House and which will disappear.
The forces that are strong in favour of 'European <unk> - notably the major financial and social partners, the Social Democrats and the rights - try to strengthen the EU as an imperialist bloc under the control of its major powers.
This report is a real guide for militarisation and <unk> in addition to the confirmation of the EU strategy for Afghanistan, <unk> Republic, the Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Guinea-Bissau <unk> and the operational <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the report, in order to give only one example, the following objectives will be to extend the 'European <unk> a military dimension of <unk> <unk> the militarisation of <unk> and <unk> as an instrument for the <unk> reinforcement of military transport (the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These and many other reasons have led us to vote against this report.
in writing. - (SV) I voted against the report because I am opposed to strengthening the EU's common foreign policy.
I am also opposed to the militarisation of the EU.
in writing. - The British Labour Party voted in favour of this report, which deals with the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the ongoing role of the <unk>
Above all, the <unk> welcomes the fact that this report focuses on the better functioning of civil <unk>
The undersigned voted against the text of paragraph 39 which concerns the role of <unk>
Although the United Kingdom is not involved in the <unk> and has never been involved in this force, it is important to emphasise that there are no permanent troops under <unk> <unk> and we believe that there is no need for such structures.
in writing. - I welcome Mr Kuhne report on the annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the ESDP and agree with the rapporteur that the Treaty of Lisbon will strengthen the Union's powers by strengthening the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The international nature of the security issues facing Member States requires greater European cooperation.
I would therefore welcome the introduction of a solidarity clause among Member States on these issues.
I voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (IT) Europe's <unk> has changed.
The risk of a territorial <unk> which is in the traditional <unk> of the <unk> has been a great deal of risks from the <unk> regions of the Union.
There is also the threat of terrorism and the sharp increase in migratory flows, the radicalisation of fundamentalists and extremists of different kinds, the increase in illegal trade and the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
For the European Union, it is not just a question of providing itself with resources to deal with international crises, but to build a genuine European <unk>
However, in the hoped-for process of extending its external capacity for action, the EU must not confine itself to the military dimension, it must commit itself to developing civil peace efforts in parallel with the involvement of <unk> civil <unk> lawyers, <unk> and so on.
Common security must therefore be strengthened in order to help the Union become a key player on the international geopolitical stage, but it must be a role which must be borne by NATO.
I voted in favour of Mr <unk> report today.
in writing. - (PT) The European Union's right to security and defence remains clearly behind its opportunities, and this is not only the traditional problem of the coordination and cooperation of foreign policy priorities.
There is also a key problem that needs to be resolved.
We know that there is no shortage of staff, availability and cooperation.
It is also important for the public to recognise the need and the usefulness of this cooperation.
In the annex to this strategy we need to build on cooperation - with particular attention to interoperability and operational capabilities on the ground, but above all there is a lack of public support in this dimension of our policy.
To what extent security and safety is recognised as a necessary and effective recognition of the security and security policy, is very much dependent on the support of the citizens we need and there is a great deal of work to be done there.
Finally, I would like to stress that we should not forget that the <unk> alliance is the most important pillar of European security and defence and must not be forgotten under any circumstances.
in writing. - (FR) The two reports on the Common Foreign and Security Policy and on the security and defence policy that is being voted on today have one thing in common: the Member States are deprived of their foreign and defence policy in favour of the Brussels officials.
Diplomacy will be in the hands of a High Representative, a real <unk>
And since it is to be together, the defence of defence will be <unk> this time under the United States <unk> on NATO and the UN, as stated in the text of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Treaty of Lisbon is clearly being said.
Our military resources are reduced to their simplest expression, because the majority of the budget is spent today by France and the United Kingdom and is subject to the stability pact.
The permanent seats of France and the United Kingdom in the UN Security Council are to be merged into a single seat which grants a European <unk>
In short, none of the countries of the Union will have more about the political and military means to guarantee their independence and freedom.
But it is true that they have already largely <unk> them in favour of the <unk>
We are firmly opposed to this disastrous development.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I supported the motion for a resolution on the <unk> states because, alongside issues such as bilateral partnership and global challenges, it is addressed to the <unk> which is very important for Polish nationals.
<unk> <unk> who want to travel as tourists to the United States still have to go through the complicated and expensive procedure for <unk>
Around 25% of Polish <unk> are rejected.
The main reason - and sometimes the only reason for the only reason - is that <unk> should be suspected of including illegal work.
In fact, most Poles travel to the United States to visit the United States.
Around three quarters of the 10 million Poles living in the United States come from <unk> which explains the long <unk> before the American consulate in <unk>
The fact that there is such a procedure for a Member State of the EU in my view shows that the Union should take a strong stance in dialogue with the United States.
in writing. - I would like to make the subject of this debate the subject of the United States, particularly with regard to the Czech Republic.
Two thirds of the Czech population is opposed to the construction of a <unk> <unk> as part of these plans.
Two Czech citizens have been in the <unk> for three weeks as protest against the persistent <unk> of these plans by the Czech Government, although there is hardly any evidence that they do anything other than improve Europe's security situation.
I welcome the fact that these two people are now being supported by <unk> politicians who are responsible for 24 hours.
I agree with them that the EU must adopt a common position on the <unk> of this <unk> in Europe.
We urgently need a debate in this Chamber together with the Council.
I hope that the President will work for this next month.
in writing. - (SV) The June List wholeheartedly supports the parts of the resolution concerning the treatment of prisoners of the Americans and their movements in transit by European countries.
In accordance with international law, the United States must either put its prisoners before a court or <unk>
The situation in Guantánamo and other prisons is totally unacceptable.
Unfortunately, the report deals with too many issues that go beyond this issue, issues for which other international bodies, the United Nations, are responsible.
We do not believe that the European Parliament should play a role when it comes to the political situation in countries that are not close to the EU, such as Iran, Kosovo or Iraq.
Nor should the European Parliament try to extend European foreign policy by calling for other countries to cooperate in cooperation and common strategies against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
These are <unk> issues that are best dealt with from the perspective of the Member States and in cooperation with international organisations which are responsible for these issues.
The June List also criticises the section of the <unk> which calls for a significant part of the EU and the United States to be spent on agricultural research.
in writing. - The British Labour Party voted in favour of this motion for a resolution in preparation for the UN Summit on 10 June.
We hope that the motion for a resolution can contribute to making this summit productive.
In particular, the <unk> call for close cooperation between the EU and the United States in various common political <unk> calls for the EU and the United States to make the Millennium Development Goals the core of international development policy at the heart of international development policy.
The British Labour MEPs abstained on Amendment No 8, because we believe that this text is not a balanced view of this problem.
We believe that the discussions also focus on Russia's commitments and have to include greater international <unk> as is expressly recommended in the successful socialist amendment for the report on the European Security and Defence Policy, which is also the vote today.
in writing. - The forthcoming presidential elections in the United States are a good way of distance from the kind of foreign policy practised by the Bush administration.
Such a change should also affect Europe and the EU should strive to strengthen the partnership between the EU and the USA, especially in global challenges such as climate change and poverty.
I support Mr <unk> motion for a resolution.
in writing. - (EL) We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece <unk> voted against the joint resolution:
• it calls for the strengthening of imperialist cooperation between the United States and the EU by strengthening NATO to manipulate and exploit peoples and states.
• it confirms the strategic <unk> <unk> against the <unk>
Even though so many hypocritical appeals are being made to respect human rights, the alliance is nothing as a pretext for waging a vigorous fight against the people.
• the resolution uses the excuse of the consequences of climate change for countries and people in order to pave the way for new imperialist interventions in the aviation sector with the United States?
• with the <unk> to treat all sides equally. The resolution supports the Israeli <unk> and their crimes at the expense of the Palestinian people.
It accepts the continued occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and proposes practical measures of cooperation between the United States and the EU in the Kosovo area.
The resolution is further proof of the irreversible strategic agreement between the EU and the United States at the expense of the population.
The resolution <unk> with political power to prove that the EU is supposedly a <unk> of the United States that it feels is <unk>
in writing. - (PT) One of the most important aspects of European policy is the way in which relations between Europe and the United States are being dealt with, especially in terms of how our relations with other partners that are politically and culturally more different from us.
Clearly, there are different opinions, <unk> competition and interests, above all legitimate <unk> which we are on different locations and positions.
But what is important is that we have the tensions and differences between partners in the same project.
This must be borne in mind in any event, so that we can act and respond to everything that has to do with us.
One of the first steps that is necessary is to reduce the <unk> which is not necessary and justified between partners such as Europe and the United States.
Similarly, if we really want to do something about the threat of poverty that is an unnecessary result of the rising global demand, it is essential to work together with each other and, above all, with the rest of the world, to ensure that countries that are in difficulties are able to open up far enough to build their own prosperity.
On the basis of a solid alliance between free societies that promote development, a better prosperous world.
in writing. - British Conservatives are strong supporters of the transatlantic <unk> but we disagree with a redefinition of these as a relationship between the EU and the US, particularly in <unk> and therefore reject a large part of paragraph 16.
in writing. - (PT) This resolution clearly reveals its <unk> contradictions and reinforces cooperation between the EU and the United States as well as the objective of developing its partnership - in particular in the light of the forthcoming US presidential elections - in the common perception of its <unk> in the world.
The resolution confirms the EU as a European pillar of NATO, as already indicated in the 'European <unk> and the EU and the United States are being called upon to <unk> a wide range of common political challenges, particularly in the Middle East, in Iran, in Iraq, in Kosovo and in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan and Africa.
With regard to the <unk> anniversary of NATO, the resolution calls for the revival of a <unk> defined and stronger partnership <unk> and emphasises the adaptation of the 'European <unk> to the new strategic concept of NATO.
According to the militarism of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the EU-US relations in the light of the outcome of the strategic thinking of NATO, the updating of the European Security Strategy and the arrival of the new US <unk>
In other words, the EU is justified and confirms it as a <unk> bloc which hopes to share the control of the trade agreement with the USA (and to try to <unk> its relations with the United States.
The world and the people it <unk>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by five groups on the Union for the Mediterranean.
The Mediterranean and the Middle East are of strategic importance for the Union and it is necessary to pursue a Mediterranean policy based on solidarity, dialogue, cooperation and exchange to meet the common challenges and to achieve the objective of creating a common area of peace, stability and prosperity.
I welcome the initiative of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is very close to this Union for the Mediterranean, and I wish the introductory summit to take place in Paris on 13 July this year.
I support the political proposal to give this future Union a parliamentary dimension by basing itself on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
At the same time, I welcome the proposed examples of initiatives such as the <unk> linking the Arab <unk> <unk> the fight against the pollution of the Mediterranean, civil protection and Mediterranean <unk> the production of <unk> <unk> in the North African <unk> the <unk> to facilitate access to drinking water etc.
in writing. - (FR) I am pleased with the adoption of the joint resolution <unk> Union for the <unk>
This resolution rightly reminds us of the strategic interest that the Mediterranean region and the Middle East represent to the European Union.
Our policy towards these countries must be based on the principles of solidarity, dialogue and cooperation.
The Barcelona Process must be renewed today in order to optimise its efficiency.
In this sense, the initiative proposed by the Commission is in the right direction and has the merit of focusing on specific regional projects which will enable them to effectively meet the needs of the citizens of this region.
The Commission's proposal also provides for the Barcelona Process to be brought under a <unk> joint committee and a secretariat, which will improve cooperation and dialogue between the various partners.
He also reminds us that the great objectives of this policy must continue to be in the promotion of the rule of law, democracy, respect for the rights and political pluralism.
in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union constantly <unk> the <unk> <unk> rejection of its proposals on the taxation of <unk> warning and now the transformation of the Union project for the Mediterranean into a revival of the <unk> which has failed for more than ten years.
This is the death knell for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> under French leadership.
Now the whole of the Union is affected and the Brussels Commission will lead the way.
That is the real head of the <unk> which Germany <unk>
This affair <unk> two <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, only conceal his <unk> France's interests lie in the hands of the Brussels officials and are subordinate to those of the European Union.
Let us ensure that the Irish, this <unk> people who have paid dearly for this in the course of his history, may be it who will lose us from this <unk> which is increasingly losing legitimacy and becoming increasingly <unk>
in writing. - (PT) If you only read the resolution adopted today, we would be inclined to believe in the EU's very honest and positive intentions towards the <unk> <unk>
The careful wording of the language shows a few references to interference and the <unk> objectives of the <unk> of a free trade area and of the <unk> <unk> of course, of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
However, the European Commission is making it clear that 'the Mediterranean region <unk> politically and economically an area of fundamental strategic importance for the European Union?
It talks about the fact that the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area by the year 2010 has made significant progress in the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area <unk> and it indicates that the EU's Mediterranean partners need <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The Commission proposes a number of priorities, such as transport (and the possibility of introducing a <unk> <unk> which could be of considerable interest to the private sector and accompanied by state measures to safeguard free trade and to remove barriers to trade, and to strengthen the integration of the <unk>
The EU wants to control the entire Mediterranean region economically, politically and militarily and try to control its markets and exploit its huge resources.
That is the <unk> the <unk>
in writing. - (FR) The title of the resolution alone highlights the defeat of Mr <unk>
It was not satisfied with the post of President of the French Republic that he wanted to become the President of a Euro-Mediterranean Union that is open to the Mediterranean <unk>
Before the European Council Presidency begins its <unk> it is <unk>
Germany has <unk> all the countries of the European Union will be participating in this project that it is designed to develop the Barcelona process under the leadership of the Brussels <unk>
This fiasco illustrates the <unk> of our country in the European institutions.
The Brussels Europe is far from strengthening France, as the <unk> and the <unk> claim it, but it weakens it in all sectors in the economy, with the destruction of our <unk> the destruction and the relocation of our military forces in the military area, with the dismantling of our army, which is in a <unk> <unk> with immigration that calls into question our national identity.
Only a new Europe, the Europe of <unk> based on the sovereignty of the States and the fundamental values of our European and Christian civilisation, will allow France to become a power once again and to implement a major policy of cooperation that is aimed at returning immigrants to their homes.
in writing. - (NL) For some time now, the European Union has been trying to develop special cooperation with the African and Asian countries of the Mediterranean.
This cooperation is always the question of whether we do not support the dictatorship in Syria or take Israel’s delay in the establishment of a <unk> internationally recognised <unk> <unk>
The proposal made by the French President for the creation of a special Union between the EU and all the Mediterranean countries is particularly reflected in the <unk> of the EU and the general public.
The creation of such a Union could help to ensure - according to the example of the traditional agreements between the USA and parts of Latin America - the EU in the region of <unk> with <unk> partners.
It could also serve to legitimise dictatorships in Tunisia, Libya and Syria, to a lesser extent, Algeria and Egypt.
It would facilitate the repatriation of refugees to these countries.
It would also give us the opportunity to <unk> relations with Israel now, instead of waiting for the recognition of a Palestinian <unk>
Because of these underlying problems, I will not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution.
in writing. - (EL) The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the joint resolution.
The Union for the Mediterranean has no equal relations with the states in the Mediterranean region.
Instead, it supports the imperialist plans of the EU for the other region of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
The aim of this Union is to liberalise markets in order to make them easier for European monopolies whose position will be improved in the monopolistic struggle for the control of markets.
The wealth and wealth of the region will be <unk>
The Union for the Mediterranean is achieved by stepping up the threat, blackmail and political or even military pressure on states and populations.
The resolution also highlights <unk>
The Union's primary objective for the Mediterranean is to export democracy and human rights from the EU to the Mediterranean countries.
This is the pretext used by the EU to justify its imperialist intervention.
What is actually being promoted is the imperialist <unk> for the <unk> Middle East.
That is why there is no point in the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories or the genocide of the Palestinian people.
People should not be under any illusions about the nature and objectives of the Union for the Mediterranean. They should fight against it.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the proportion of <unk> in the EU is falling.
Currently, only 7% of farmers are younger than 35 years.
In many cases, young people are turning their backs on agriculture because of the high level of unemployment that makes it impossible to compete on the market.
We should therefore help young farmers to use EU funds for their work.
With <unk> loans, young farmers could implement their plans without having to risk high debt.
We must also ensure that the criteria for access to EU aid are not too strict and that small farms that focus more on selected products than large-scale production should not be excluded.
In <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> most farmers have such small farms.
Mr <unk> report addresses all these problems and I therefore voted in favour.
in writing. - (FR) In view of the difficulties faced by the renewal of European farmers, the European Parliament has begun to consider how to promote the establishment of young farmers in the CAP health check.
As shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group, I have made the following suggestions.
It is a priority to respond to the <unk> in the areas of food, energy, the environment and regional planning.
Young farmers have to benefit from support measures, especially those who have not <unk> the operation and who are in areas with a permanent natural <unk> <unk> <unk> for agricultural loans and accompanying measures after the <unk>
These support measures must be mandatory within the framework of the second pillar of the CAP, and the question of access to land must be examined.
The living conditions in the country must be improved, equal access to public services, areas for social life etc.
We need to improve access to vocational training while training and access to knowledge of <unk>
We need to promote the profession of <unk> and introduce standards that apply to farmers at European level.
in writing. - (SV) The EU should not deal with everything.
The principle of a <unk> but <unk> EU requires that these only deal with issues on which it is authorised in accordance with its budgetary authority and in terms of proportionality, proportionality, efficiency and relevance to it.
I abstained from the final vote on the report on future prospects for young farmers in view of the current reform of the CAP.
The report contains many proposals that improve the situation of <unk> young farmers, and proposals that can contribute to increased food production.
At the same time, however, the text deals with certain issues that are definitely of national relevance and should be decided at national level.
in writing. - (PT) Many proposals in this report, on which we have tabled a number of amendments, are heading in the right direction, especially those relating to the <unk> existing <unk> for young farmers, such as high prices, high debt and too few available.
We have put forward various proposals to which we want to draw the European Commission for the future, in particular as follows:
the need to take the necessary measures to support young farmers within the framework of the regulation on <unk> in order to increase the number of successful branches and, at the same time, to minimise or minimise the number of cases where the establishment of the establishment or even <unk>
to support the establishment of a <unk> <unk> which will be formed from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the need to introduce aid for the common procurement of expensive equipment and equipment used by individual companies.
However, we believe that the measures adopted to resolve the problems that have been decided by Portugal with the lowest proportion of young farmers have been <unk>
It is essential to pay due attention to productive activity under the current review of the common agricultural policy with fair prices for production.
in writing. - (PT) In recent decades, the rural exodus in Europe has increased and this development is accompanied by a gradual ageing population.
This ageing of the population working in agriculture gives rise to concern about the future of European agriculture.
That is why I consider the <unk> report to be very important because it highlights the various aspects of the expectations and opportunities of young farmers, which have a crucial role to play in the sustainable development of Europe's rural areas.
I believe that young farmers are particularly important when it comes to developing a dynamic agricultural sector so that the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy can be achieved.
That is why the new common agricultural policy must be considered as a priority.
in writing. - (PL) It is very good that the European Parliament has adopted the report on future prospects for young farmers in view of the current reform of the common agricultural policy.
What is particularly important is the statements on the expansion of EU aid to <unk>
One of these declarations concerns easier access to loans for this group of farmers.
Further practical assistance is needed in order to provide a real prospect of an adequate income for those who want to continue with the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
If the promised aid is to bear fruit, situations like <unk> may be <unk> there are often only elderly people in the villages and they are still <unk> while the parents of children can only see a chance to work abroad.
That is why this report has not only an economic, but also a social dimension.
Young farmers want to maintain tradition, but they are also aware that they have to use new experience and technologies if they want to transform parental into a <unk> <unk> and <unk> company.
That is why promoting the development of modern processes and agricultural equipment and equipment is a particularly important point in the resolution adopted today.
in writing. - (SV) As always, we have to say in the June List that it is beneficial in this situation that the European Parliament does not have a right of codecision in matters of EU agricultural policy, because then the Union would be trapped in a trap of protectionism and massive subsidies for all groups in the agricultural industry.
This own-initiative report contains a number of absurd proposals, such as a further 'European <unk> for dialogue between town and country.
If all the 'European <unk> proposed by the European Parliament were to be carried out, it would probably be possible for all the years to come to the end of this century.
The demand made in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be targeted directly at farmers, strengthens the theory of the <unk> which has now changed the old, <unk> <unk> in the EU budget only its name in <unk> of the rural <unk>
We are concerned at the fact that the European Parliament now calls for the inclusion of not <unk> concerns such as <unk> in the WTO negotiations.
In our view, this is nothing more than a preparation for the establishment of <unk> and protectionism against the rest of the world.
That is why I decided to vote against the report.
in writing. - The <unk> report on the future prospects for young farmers highlights some important issues that are important in all the rural areas of the EU.
The report also recognises that <unk> which are rooted in certain geographical areas and cultural traditions, should be improved and encouraged.
I fully support these opinions and believe that they can be applied throughout the EU.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the measures agreed in it can complement national programmes in this area.
The national programme for the development of the rural areas in Romania contains a measure offering grants from the EU fund for rural development to EUR <unk> per person.
However, difficult conditions must be met so that we can only have a small number of requests for it.
The report adopted today provides for a number of significant measures to be taken both in terms of support for young farmers and for certain important legal aspects, such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and easier access to <unk>
The <unk> and <unk> for young people is also important.
I therefore believe that future legislation of the great inequality between the younger population and 35 years that operates in the agricultural sector must take account of <unk> of all farmers in <unk> and the other <unk> in this area.
These measures will clearly contribute to the success of the national programmes that are the main beneficiaries of support for young farmers and agreed in the National Development Plan for <unk> Development <unk>
<unk>
Is it the question of the content of the <unk> after the future prospects or the rapid money?
All these questions will often be answered in a negative way if the profession of the <unk>
Only 7% of farmers are under 35 years of age, and this is an alarming <unk>
There are many young people who welcome the work of the farmers in the work of a free nature, with animals and plants.
Is it the future or a general uncertainty that young people <unk>
If the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was an excellent and <unk> the person who took over the Court is often disadvantaged by many of the burdens and conditions.
We know that only well-educated and motivated farmers in Europe can guarantee our standard of living in the healthy food and healthy environment.
However, we must also be aware of the challenges facing young farmers.
We need to involve young farmers more in the political discussions and decisions.
They are the <unk>
They address the multiple challenges of ecology and the economy and provide a good balanced social environment in rural areas.
They need the reliability of politics.
in writing. - (FR) I am pleased with the adoption of this report, which shows the fundamental challenge of the renewal of the generations of farmers for the European Union.
Young farmers are probably best placed to respond to the new agricultural challenges.
Their wealth is in the experience of their fathers, and they have the necessary dynamism and enthusiasm to take the necessary <unk> technological and economic changes that will enable European agriculture to continue to occupy a leading place in the world.
In the future, therefore, it is important to reconcile an agricultural production system and a <unk> effort for quality and safety, all of them in the context of a global concern of conservation of resources and natural environment.
However, these requirements require more and more financial and human investment.
That is why the acquisition of the relevant material and intellectual instruments by these young farmers, as called for in the report, must be subject to increased support from the Union, especially in the area of access to technological innovation.
The CAP cannot afford to neglect those who will ensure that the Community is sustainable in respect of human beings and the environment.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Mr <unk> report because I can only support the initiatives aimed at ensuring the future of sustainable, competitive and productive agriculture in the EU.
It is important to promote and facilitate the access of young people to the agricultural and food sector, to promote a renewal of the generations and to ensure the dynamism of the sector.
In order to enable young farmers to meet the multiple challenges and expectations, such as the production of high-quality food, the preservation of food safety, the preservation of biodiversity, the preservation of biodiversity and <unk> it is essential to review the level of <unk> which has been unchanged for years.
It is also necessary to ensure that this premium does not be linked to a <unk> in order to avoid the <unk> of young farmers.
It is also important to note that the farmers are facing the same challenges.
We must ensure that they are not disadvantaged and that they are damaged by their existing <unk>
in writing. - It is vital for the future of the agricultural sector to encourage young people to enter agriculture.
<unk> in the agricultural sector, including <unk> should receive support.
I support the general thrust of the <unk> report on the future prospects for young farmers in view of the current reform of the CAP and I have voted accordingly.
in writing. - Statistics show that the rural population in Europe is <unk> and at the same time <unk>
Moreover, the number of farms that are being run by young people is extremely low.
This is a worrying trend affecting all Member States.
Young people do not see agriculture as a <unk> because in many cases issues such as the <unk> for farms and <unk> are simply more than the benefits of a <unk>
This <unk> report addresses the most important problems that young people are being kept away from agriculture and proposes some practical solutions to dealing with these problems.
Finally, if we want to safeguard the stability and development of Europe's agricultural sector, we must offer young people incentives to get back into agriculture and remove the obstacles to them.
The report also recognises that agriculture, like any other modern industry, needs competitiveness, efficiency and capacity to respond to the needs of the market.
We must take measures to support and encourage young people in this context, because the next generation of farmers is the key to a dynamic and innovative European agricultural sector.
Like other new EU Member States, Slovakia has a large proportion of rural areas.
<unk> areas account for almost 80% of the country's <unk> and according to the statistics, over 44% of the population live there.
The main challenges facing the European rural areas are the current situation in the <unk> the high food prices and the production of quality food.
It is good to see that young farmers in particular are interested in organic farming.
This gives a certain guarantee of the growing importance of agriculture to rural development.
The spirit of enterprise in agriculture has its own characteristics and brings much greater risks than the entrepreneurial spirit in other areas.
Many young people think that the creation of an agricultural <unk> is impossible because of high costs.
The introduction of various incentives can promote the establishment of young farmers or help them modernise their operation.
I voted in favour of the report by the rapporteur, <unk> <unk> on future prospects for young farmers in view of the current reform of the common agricultural policy, because I am convinced that by promoting young farmers, we can make a significant contribution to improving employment in European peripheral regions and to hold young people from rural depopulation.
in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report, but I must stress that Amendment No 35 is unacceptable and that the British Labour Party and I will vote against this particular amendment.
Sustainable development in rural areas is the best way to preserve our rural areas and the traditional way of life of our rural communities.
As far as modulation is concerned, Members may recall that only the British Labour MEPs have supported joint efforts to steer our priorities away from direct payments and towards sustainable development of rural areas.
Farmers play a crucial role in the sustainability and development of rural areas, but they are not the only people who are involved and I cannot support Amendment No 35.
This Parliament has become a habit of constantly demanding direct payments to farmers, and it will certainly do the same if we are to discuss the <unk>
I think that those of us who believe that things need to change in this respect - from a system that rewards inefficiency at the expense of efficient agriculture - are also those who believe in the sustainable development of rural areas.
in writing. - (EL) The ageing of <unk> the abandonment of forests and the constant decline in the number of young farmers in agriculture are developments that have been taking place for 20 years.
In all these years, the EU has failed to address the problems of small and medium-sized farmers, and especially young people.
The EU measures are part of their <unk> which aims to reduce production and to focus on the country in the hands of a few large <unk>
So the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> are going to continue in particular among young people.
The report is limited to results.
The proposed measures are moving within the framework of this policy, so that the real reasons behind these problems are hidden behind these problems.
This course of action, along with the CAP against agriculture, is aimed at promoting and increasing the profits of the multinational monopolies and putting the income of small and medium-sized enterprises at risk.
The report provides active support for the CAP reform in 2003, the proposed measures for the <unk> and the inclusion of agriculture into the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy.
The <unk> and anti-grass roots policy of the EU is the only solution that would allow farmers to stay on their land.
This would guarantee a decent income instead of strengthening the objectives and interests of the multinational monopolies.
in writing. - (PL) As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his report, which I fully support.
The work of this Assembly and, in particular, the opportunity for Members of Parliament to link direct contacts with each other in direct terms, will contribute significantly to the presence of the European Union in the most remote regions of Africa, the Caribbean and the <unk>
The Assembly is focusing not only on its action programme, but also on current events and <unk>
Finally, the Assembly is taking resolutions and is making decisions on the basis of material and financial assistance.
This aid is urgently needed in regions affected by natural disasters.
I am particularly pleased to see the organisational framework.
Since the meetings take place in Europe and in a country of <unk> the members of the Assembly can better understand and understand the situation on the ground.
I also support the event of workshops and information and information campaigns within the framework of the Assembly.
I particularly welcome the idea of a forum for women as an opportunity to discuss the issue of equality between men and women and to exchange good experiences on this.
If the European Parliament wants to be seen as a democracy in the ACP countries in the ACP countries, I do not think it can be closed to the injustice that women have to experience so often.
in writing. - (PT) While we welcome the inclusion and participation of national parliaments and Members of Parliament in the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) of the EU with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, we are of the opinion that the political attitude towards these EPAs should not be limited to the procedure while the content is not mentioned.
If we were to deal with this issue, it would be a <unk> attempt to create the basic problem, namely the planned objective of <unk> on the conclusion of free trade agreements.
Through these agreements, the EU will force these countries to open up their markets to opening up their markets to their markets where they sell their goods and services to exploit their goods and services, to exploit their raw materials and to impose a <unk> <unk> which will make them dependent on the interests of the EU.
That is the nature of the <unk>
If it is the case, we will reap our capitalist intentions for most of the <unk> unemployment, poverty, hunger and so on.
That is why we must say no to the EPAs and the <unk>
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Hutchinson report.
The work that this Parliament has done over recent decades, together with the ACP countries, can fulfil a certain degree of satisfaction as an institution.
in writing. - (FI) I have been a member of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly since my first term of office.
In my opinion, Mr <unk> report on the work of the Assembly in 2007 contains a comprehensive presentation of both the progress of recent years and the challenges we have been facing.
I think that the fact that the standing committees are now also responsible for pursuing the resolutions is definitely a step in the right direction.
This offers the opportunity for a much more intensive dialogue than in the past with the rather formal legislative procedures in plenary.
In addition, the Assembly plays a central role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements <unk> interaction between Members of Parliament and has encouraged the transparency of the process and making it easier to take account of the actual facts.
It is precisely because of this type of activity that I think the Parliamentary Assembly has become an important player in the Doha Round.
Strengthening the parliamentary dimension and close cooperation in the Baltic Sea region will contribute more and more to ensuring that EU funds are directly allocated to people's needs and for example to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for health and education.
in writing. - I welcome Mr <unk> report on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly <unk> 2007.
Greater participation by the parliaments and civil society can help improve and strengthen relations between the ACP countries and the EU.
Through such cooperation, we can improve the quality and objective of development aid.
I therefore voted in favour of the report's recommendations.
I very much welcome the report by Mr Hutchinson on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly <unk> last year.
I would like to pick up on a number of aspects of this report, which have really impressed me.
It is very much to be welcomed that the rapporteur refers to Economic Partnership Agreements <unk>
The European Union must monitor the development of the EPAs and the negotiations on them, and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has guaranteed this.
As the rapporteur says, the Assembly plays an important role in terms of negotiating the negotiations and establishing links between the two sides, between the EU and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
I would also like to commend the rapporteur for describing Somalia as a <unk> <unk>
However, Somalia is not isolated and we in the EU and the ACP countries are obliged to give our support, help and attention to these regions.
Above all, this report highlights the good work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and which sometimes fails to pay sufficient attention to it.
in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur rightly points out that it is necessary to establish a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue to negotiate the economic partnership agreements between the European Union and ACP countries.
Another important aspect is the growing involvement of national parliaments and societies of individual countries in order to strengthen the <unk>
Particular emphasis should be placed on regional cooperation and integration.
<unk> measures should also be supported, especially in the ACP countries where the situation remains unstable.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the adoption of the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
I consider the proposal to be useful for the permanent committee of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be consulted by hearing the Commission officials responsible for the relevant areas.
So far, this has taken place only at the plenary sessions.
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has a lot of tasks to do, and above all the promotion of economic development in the ACP countries.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report, which makes another important contribution to the economic development of Europe.
I therefore welcome the excellent work done by Mr Pittella, who has clearly expressed the proposals and principles that should be dealt with in such an important area.
The harmonisation of the VAT system is a further step forward towards an extremely important objective: the completion of a truly integrated internal market in which the Member States are to be overcome by the Member States.
Financial services are in general economic interest, because they play a fundamental role both for economic development and for the effective implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
I am thinking of the citizens who have great difficulty in obtaining accurate information, and to the <unk> - often in the form of high <unk> - who are trying to change the <unk>
in writing. - (PT) The report adopted today contains some positive aspects, namely information on the simplification of procedures for consumers, but access to these services remains within the framework of a liberalised financial market, where the achievement of maximum profits and not the protection of consumers is the priority.
Hence our abstention.
It is not enough to guarantee the right to a bank account.
We must ensure that costs or any charges for services do not have to be borne by the customers, especially since this would hit the people worst <unk> who have only limited amounts of money on their accounts or carrying out only limited transactions or simply have a bank account.
It is essential that we ensure the public service, which also exists in the financial sector, because otherwise the social inequalities will increase, which would dramatically affect people with less financial resources, <unk> facilities and other social organisations, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
in writing. - The Pittella report, which I supported, emphasises the importance of culture, habits and language for consumer protection and consumer protection.
The different cultures, habits and languages of the EU deserve respect in all the Union's <unk> and are of crucial importance if the work of the European institutions is to be given public support.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the work of the committee responsible, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr Karas, has taken a step forward and has been helpful to clarify the problems and resolve of the problems in this area.
I also welcome the fact that special emphasis is finally placed on small businesses and not on the big capital movements.
The financial services sector does not only benefit the large companies that are at European level or continents. It is also an essential instrument for anyone who wants to pay new <unk> and <unk> through their own local market.
<unk> the European Union at high level will certainly lead to greater competition and lower costs for consumers, which should have a positive impact on the increasing choice and access of customers to these services.
In view of the importance of this sector and the benefits that may arise from improvements in the legal provisions, I am pleased to see that, thanks to this report, Parliament will finally be able to propose the right measures to be taken directly to consumers.
in writing. - (PT) The liberalisation of financial services in the internal market is the most recent proposal by the European Commission in the context of the European Commission proposed in the Lisbon Strategy.
This is a further step towards the complete liberalisation of services in the European Union.
As with other initiatives, and as with other initiatives, the liberalisation of various financial services is now proposed in particular by <unk> insurance and insurance companies.
The aim is to remove everything that could be regarded as <unk> and the old arguments of lower prices and greater choice for consumers are once again in the field where experience shows that the opposite is true.
More and more profit will make the big companies more expensive because services will become more expensive.
While we are pleased that our group's amendment has been adopted, there is a special <unk> in the marketing of <unk> and <unk> as consumers are usually of great importance in this regard and generally only in life, but it is clear that most of the report is negative.
We therefore voted against it.
in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur rightly points out, we need a market and demand for a market.
This does not seem to me to be the case with a cross-border market for financial services for <unk>
Moreover, the report is based on the principle that the authorisation of supply will inevitably promote demand.
However much of us are interested in including cheaper loans or making <unk> <unk> it will not be tomorrow an Italian or a Cypriot bank to buy a loan in a Danish or Cypriot bank to buy its house or car.
And everyone understands the problems of language, with the right understanding of the risks, with the right understanding of risks, uncertainty regarding the tax system and so on. The rapporteur stresses the importance of the terms of confidence, proximity of personal relations for the consumer.
This desire to create artificially such a market can only conceal the fact that one of the main objectives of the EU budget is to impose regulatory and regulatory harmonisation on the Member States in order to be able to cope with each other or to impose an 28 <unk> the euro zone would be in the introduction of the euro by the countries that have so far rejected this hypothetical market.
We cannot support these proposals.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Karas report on financial services for <unk>
My own country, Scotland, is the headquarters of some of the world's <unk> <unk> which can benefit from access to the whole single market.
Nevertheless, the various financial cultures and traditions of the Member States must be preserved and I believe that the Karas report is right to say that the principle of subsidiarity must be applied.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the report on the financial services market in financial services for <unk> in the <unk> because consumer access to cross-border passenger services is an important factor in strengthening the internal market in a high level of consumer protection.
It is necessary to strengthen consumer awareness of cross-border financial services through awareness-raising campaigns at national and European level.
Romania must promote the awareness and knowledge of consumers about the information system, which plays a key role in coordinating information for the public with regard to access to legal <unk> and alternative solutions, especially with regard to cross-border <unk>
I fully support the reports by Mr Karas and Mr <unk> which concern their efforts to ensure a more effective and more effective banking sector for small businesses and small businesses.
In particular, I agree with the paragraph in Mr Karas' report which emphasises self-regulation as a substitute for the introduction of new legislation.
Legislation is not always the <unk> every case needs to be carefully investigated and examined, and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be carefully <unk>
Often what is used to the sector is the customer too.
However, I have a great deal of difficulty with a paragraph in Mr Karas, in which he addresses the differences in tax law in the various Member States.
This paragraph seems to me to be a criticism of the principle of subsidiarity, and it is not true.
It is up to the individual states to define their own <unk> and these <unk> promote competition in the internal market and not the other way round.

Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 5 June 2008.
Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two statements.
I give the second statement on behalf of the Conference of Presidents.
The outcome of the vote on 12 June 2008 in Ireland leads the European Union into one of the most difficult challenges of its history.
The Lisbon Reform Treaty came out of the Constitutional Treaty, which was drawn up by a publicly elected Convention, which was drawn up by the national and European Members, allowing the European Union more democracy, more and more transparency, more transparency.
It strengthens the European Parliament, giving national parliaments more responsibility in shaping the <unk> initiatives to the European institutions in relation to the European institutions and guarantees local authorities.
The Treaty of Lisbon is the response to critical assessments of citizens with regard to deficits in the European Union.
This Treaty brings the European Union closer to its citizens.
We must not allow the implementation of the Reform Treaty to be an absolute necessity for the European Union to defend its values and interests in the 21st century.
Without the reforms made by the Treaty of Lisbon, the accession of other countries to the European Union is hardly possible.
We call on the EU summit next Thursday and Friday in Brussels to take all appropriate steps to implement the Reform Treaty.
The ratification process must be fully continued.
We ask the Irish Government to put forward proposals on how we can overcome this difficult phase of European policy.
The European Parliament will be using all the strength and commitment to address these challenges.
We expect this also from the European Commission and from all the governments of the Member States of the European Union.
We also expect the European Parliament to be fully involved in the work.
Our aim remains to put the Treaty of Lisbon into effect to the European Parliament elections in June 2009.
I will be voting in favour of these principles - your agreement, provided - in Brussels on 19 and 20 June in Brussels.
(Applause)
The debate will take place on Wednesday with the Council and the Commission.
It is not intended to discuss this now, but the debate on the preparation of the European Council, and it makes sense that we should then discuss it with the Council and the Commission on this.
We have to hold a very structured debate, and these were my convictions in this debate.
I also made it because the former President of the European Parliament, Simone <unk> who was a high award ceremony on Wednesday in Spain, asked me personally to keep the <unk>
I have not been able to escape this request and I have been concerned that you also know my personal opinion on the events in Dublin and the challenges facing us.
The Conference of Presidents asked me to make a statement on the Middle East.
A <unk> delegation from our <unk> delegation visited 30 May 2008 under the leadership of <unk> De Keyser and <unk> <unk> Israel and Palestine.
On the ground, the concrete implementation of the objectives of the <unk> Conference six months ago has been assessed jointly by all parties to the objectives that a two-state solution has been set up by the end of this year.
<unk> were the strengthening of the security forces by the Palestinians themselves, the question of the development of settlements, in particular Jerusalem, economic development, restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank and, finally, the humanitarian situation in isolated and international sanctions.
The decision adopted unanimously - and the delegation was also representative of the delegation - which was presented last week in the presence of the Council and the Commission and sent the Conference of Presidents to the Conference of Presidents.
Some encouraging progress has been made, but unfortunately it is proving to be <unk> and limited.
There is no reason to be optimistic.
According to the current state of affairs, the ambitious objectives of <unk> are hardly realised.
The delegation also takes the view that the Conference of Presidents agrees with the Conference of Presidents that the blockade of Gaza will remove the flow of traffic of goods and persons from goods and persons and to put an end to violence.
There is also a new course of action on the West Bank to promote the credibility of the Palestinian Authority, and the conditions for sustainable economic development must be sustainable.
The policy applied by Israel is constantly <unk> and <unk>
<unk> with the American Government, which was declared yesterday by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, is calling for the spread of settlements, particularly in <unk>
We are of the opinion that no one has the right to escape the commitments agreed in <unk>
Israelis and Palestinians have committed themselves to negotiations in good faith and in the spirit of reconciliation.
This is a way of taking a serious approach.
The courage and strength of political renewal.
It is up to us Europeans to accompany and support our partners in this process.
The European Parliament will exercise its responsibilities with determination.
The European Union's relations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority must be developed in such a way that they promote the peace process as a whole.
The Barcelona Process - the Union for the Mediterranean - could be an additional element of the <unk>
The European Parliament expects to be properly consulted in the context of European efforts for peace in the Middle East.
While we meet here, fishermen in Gaza leave their boats to water.
Because of the <unk> there is an outrageous environmental pollution that threatens the livelihood of fishermen and against which they are <unk>
They are demonstrating their rights on their right to <unk> on life, freedom and peace.
Our delegation has promised the fishermen.
On behalf of all of us, I would therefore like to express the solidarity of the European Parliament.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for having listened to this statement on which the Conference of Presidents asked me.

The final draft agenda of this part-session has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
<unk> Thursday:
No change.
Wednesday:
The IND/DEM Group has requested that the debate on the preparation of the European Council should be followed up by the European Council following the referendum in <unk>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I would like to propose the title <unk> of the European <unk> as follows following the referendum in <unk>
(Parliament gave its assent)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we have just changed the title of the debate and, given the importance - although there are different views - the decision in Ireland would be sensible for this House to have some time to discuss these problems.
That is why we are asking for the postponement of the second round of part-sessions this morning.
Now I know that the time is short, but this postponement is useful in view of the urgency and importance of this Council.
We would have no objection if one or another item were to be postponed to a later session, but at least we are now asking for us to discuss the title of the amended title and its content, so that it is sufficient to do so.
Mr President, as rapporteur on the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to support this proposal.
We have to hold a broad debate and show that we are listening to the position of the Irish people and that all of the other Member States, the <unk> if not all, want to advance this Treaty.
Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon and the events in Ireland are very important, but they should not prejudice the debate on an issue like fisheries.
I have to say that many Members have no great interest in fishing.
But if fishing has ever experienced a real crisis, it is that that we are dealing with now.
On 23 June, the European Union Agriculture and Fisheries Council will take a series of decisions on the crisis in the fisheries sector, which is <unk> and structural nature.
I do not think that the European Union fisheries sector would have understood if Parliament did not take the time to examine and adopt a position.
That is why I ask the political groups to show some openness and to contribute once again to a debate on the crisis in the fisheries sector.
(Parliament gave its assent)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to ask two questions.
The first question is <unk> which Mr Swoboda <unk> calling for more time for the debate on the European Council and the subject of referendum.
The second question is whether we should separate the debate on oil prices from which fisheries should be separated or a single debate on both subjects.
These are two separate issues.
I propose first of all to clarify the question of speaking time for the debate on the European Council and only then the question of fisheries.
(Parliament approved the first request and rejected the second <unk>
(The order of business was adopted)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
(EL) Mr President, I have to say that I am very grateful to you for your report.
I listened carefully to her opinion on the Irish 'no' and I fully agree with her reference to the need for the ratification process to continue.
It is true that the Irish has rejected the Treaty at a time when the EU is becoming more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.
But we must get the message from the factors that led to this 'no' vote.
The Irish citizens have decided and their democratic right <unk> but this 'no' also requires us to exercise constructive <unk>
I propose that we focus on two points: the Commission is bombing us formally with its <unk> we, the European Parliament, cannot deal with each detail of these legal and regulatory matters.
Mr President, I know how much you are concerned about the European project, and I call on the European Parliament to act as a political body in this situation as a political body, which serves as a <unk> for the desired direction in which European integration is to move forward.
Thank you very much, Mr <unk> for your encouragement but I would also ask you to keep to the time because one minute is scheduled for this explanation of vote.
I was also given a different issue to which you wanted to speak.
(ES) Mr President, although there was no time for my speech in the last part-session and since then, I think it was worth remembering that 12 May was the International Day for <unk> and <unk> <unk> which mainly affects women.
Both these are gender-specific diseases which are difficult to <unk> and which are limited to research and treatment.
As a rule, they cause problems in the workplace, as people do not understand how to reduce the skills of sufferers and lead to <unk>
We should take this situation seriously and try to find out the causes of these diseases to a greater extent than to provide the results of the results and, at the same time, to strengthen the social awareness of their social, legal and employment consequences.
The people concerned must not feel without being protected.
We owe this to our citizens.
(BG) The forthcoming French Presidency of the European Union comes at a crucial moment for the European integration process on the Old continent.
Issues such as the strategy for sustainable development, the European <unk> the Europe of defence and reform of the common agricultural policy are essential for Europe.
But at the heart of the matter is the question of how to continue the reform of the Union by Ireland and to deepen the integration process.
With the Irish rejection of the Irish opposition, once again the European Union's common will has been put to the test the challenges of globalisation.
It is now France as a <unk> of the European Union and its President Nicolas Sarkozy, who will once again be able to work in their efforts to establish a <unk> and an action plan and an action plan which will break out of the <unk> because if we do not overcome this crisis, we run the risk that separatist and nationalist sentiments will prevail and the enlargement of the European Union in the future.
We must be aware of this turning point, and we must respond to our responsibilities and the expectations of a majority of the citizens of the Union, for which the <unk> has already become a second <unk>
(PL) Mr President, today I would like to talk about a case that has recently occurred in Warsaw.
A person from the Chinese embassy in Poland attacked a woman who had the opposition <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Similar incidents have been going on in New York for some time in New York where supporters of <unk> <unk> and people who demonstrate peacefully for Tibet have been attacked by groups organised by the Chinese <unk>
If such incidents are repeated in other countries, we will be faced with an open breach of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.
And despite the fact that the Chinese regime is making every effort to demonstrate its positive side during the Olympic Games, it continues to pursue all the groups that do not represent the Communist ideology.
China goes even further by doubling its efforts and transferring these activities to Western democratic countries.
I therefore call on the authorities of the EU and the Member States to monitor the situation and to react decisively if the incidents I have described.
(EL) Mr President, today is the General Affairs Council.
I do not yet know the results, but in addition to many issues, it is about the proposal to develop relations between Israel and the EU.
Furthermore, the fishermen of the Gaza Strip are today demonstrating against the inhumane measures imposed by the Israeli Government against them.
Israel bans them on the one hand in their open <unk> on the one hand, but also denying them the necessary <unk> so that they have to fish in the waters of the waters to which waste water is <unk>
This situation could lead to epidemics within a very short space of time.
Mr President, I would like to remind you of the request of these fishermen that in these circumstances the EU should not consider developing relations with Israel.
Another reason why this extension is not to be considered at present is that it is particularly important for us Members of the European Parliament that Israel has recently demonstrated once again that it does not even respect our human rights.
The national forces have prevented peaceful demonstrators from protesting against the construction of the racist <unk> and <unk> including our colleague Luisa <unk>
(BG) In this House, within the Commission and in Bulgaria, the fight against corruption at the highest level is an important issue.
But corruption is not just an empty concept.
There are real people behind it.
I would like to make you familiar with the face of state corruption at the highest possible level.
Yesterday, the largest Bulgarian daily newspaper <unk> the leader of the Turkish minority of the Turkish minority, <unk> Ahmed <unk> who was given the mandate to set up the Bulgarian Government three years ago.
These shocking images are to be seen that Mr <unk> is in a huge <unk> <unk> who is as a <unk> and that the luxury.
It was precisely this man who said that his party surrounded a circle of companies and the <unk> in Europe was on the agenda.
He reported that he was mainly concerned with the leadership of his company, which he is not entitled to do as a Member of the Bulgarian Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, <unk> <unk> is one of the <unk> of corruption in Bulgaria.
In order to combat this <unk> we must first look at the circle of companies and the <unk> of Ahmed <unk>
Mr President, I will present you with the paper so that you can read the article itself.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the <unk> <unk> Irish who voted in the referendum against the Lisbon Treaty last Tuesday.
They voted in favour of freedom, democracy and common sense.
If the British people had allowed a referendum, they would undoubtedly have voted 'no' to even more than the Irish people.
If they were given the opportunity to say 'no' to many other European nations, as the French and the Dutch have demonstrated in 2005.
The political elite of Europe is trying to step up the ratification of the Treaty with <unk> arrogance and contempt for democracy.
The Treaty is dead and yet the EU refuses to bury it.
This persistent conflict between the EU and the Treaty is political <unk>
But the <unk> begins to <unk> and the longer we get the <unk> <unk> the worse the <unk>
We must bury the Treaty.
He <unk> the political atmosphere.
Mr <unk> the <unk> you have employed is totally inappropriate and I would like to say that as a comment.
They are in a very lively parliament.
If Parliament had not spoken, you could not have spoken as a living person here.
(Applause)
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I will speak <unk>
The Slovak Parliament has adopted a new <unk> and so it can enter into force, only the signature of the President of the Republic.
According to the law, the <unk> and names of historic figures in <unk> for pupils whose mother tongue is Hungarian from now on, are now in the Slovak <unk> thereby ignoring our age-old historical and <unk> traditions.
The new law is a serious violation of the rights of the Hungarian community living in Slovakia to use their language.
The Slovak Republic signed the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages in 2001.
Even Commissioner <unk> Orban believes that the preservation of the mother tongue is of strategic importance.
This European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is regrettable and unacceptable for Slovakia to act against European practice.
Instead of extending the rights of minorities, it does the opposite and reduces it.
As a result of the Treaty of <unk> several thousands of internally displaced persons are outside the <unk> and we have the right to use Hungarian names for these places.
Linguistic diversity is part of European cultural heritage and a valuable asset for which we are all responsible.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here.
(ES) Mr President, at the early morning of 8 June, the <unk> ETA <unk> was an attack on the offices of the <unk> <unk> <unk> while 50 people in the building and the <unk> <unk>
Fortunately, nobody has been injured but there has been a great deal of <unk>
I would be grateful if you would give a <unk>
However, I would also like to point out in this House - and I ask you to include this in the minutes - to the urgent need to put an end to the terrorist violence of ETA against the media and to guarantee the full exercise of freedom of expression.
This is an important reason for the Europeans to support the Treaty of Lisbon, which will provide the opportunity to implement common measures for the judiciary, security and fight against terrorism and not be dependent solely on bilateral and intergovernmental cooperation.
Our solidarity should therefore also focus on supporting the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Mrs <unk> as you have made me personally <unk> we are a <unk> and this solidarity always applies in this case.
Thank you for taking note of it.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, in the previous plenary session, the chairman of our group, Graham Watson, was in the process of holding a minute to Parliament in which he spoke about the <unk> incidents in Italy.
Today, unfortunately, I have to tell you that similar incidents have occurred in my country, Hungary.
A few weeks ago, three members of a <unk> in <unk> a village of around 70 kilometres from Budapest are leaving a dozen <unk> in three houses where Roma lived <unk>
On 16 April <unk> <unk> a village in <unk> a village in <unk> two houses with <unk>
A week ago, my colleague in <unk> <unk> was <unk> by extremists <unk> <unk> <unk> from our <unk>
The inhabitants of <unk> claim that the members of the <unk> are innocent when one of the suspects admitted his participation.
Nevertheless, on Friday some 150 <unk> people met a demonstration and called <unk> subsequently <unk> then several unknown <unk> people would have another <unk> despite the presence of a <unk> of 100 police officers.
I have followed the incident with your own eyes.
The police <unk> the identity of the victim of the incident by <unk>
In Italy, we are living in the same prisons, and they are of course Roma.
Commissioner Barrot, I hope that the Roma will also be able to enjoy the security based on the democratic structures of the European Union, and the definition of European citizenship for myself and my children, as well as my fellow citizens who do not belong to the Roma people.
Thank you.
.
Even if there is still so much to be desired, the solutions should be chosen so that it takes account of the context and relations between the various objectives, including the relevance of the relevant financial instruments and the costs expected to achieve the objectives.
With regard to every problem, especially when it comes to climate change, billions of people are affected by the search for solutions in the search for solutions to be reasonable and to act in a spirit of justice.
I cannot see justice in the proposal to reduce CO2 emissions.
There are two <unk> developed countries that have so far contributed to a large proportion of CO2 emissions and other pollution, but greater technological opportunities are being treated as much as countries with low carbon emissions, especially those whose economy depends on coal, and the fact that manufacturers of heavy vehicles that can achieve a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions are treated as the manufacturers of vehicles with small engines and low levels of noise for those who are <unk>
It seems that this is not about climate change, but about economic interests.
Mr President, Europe's bees are <unk> within a decade.
In America, a third of the <unk> diseases and viruses are <unk> this is now threatening our <unk>
The situation in the United States shows a dangerous snapshot of what Europe may happen if we do not act now.
At least 70 out of the <unk> crops are dependent on pollination by bees.
In the United States, bees have to be imported in order to compensate for the losses.
In the current climate, questions arise as to whether the EU is capable of covering the production of sugar with its own production, the effects of similar developments here would be devastating.
<unk> in Europe already know about the threat posed by <unk> <unk>
They are also struggling with <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which are systematically leaving <unk> and the bees are almost from the <unk>
Aid and scientific research are needed in this area.
The British Government currently provides only GBP 250 000 for the <unk>
This is a drop in the ocean of such an important issue.
<unk> are an essential part of the <unk> their disappearance does not only affect the <unk> but also the <unk> the fruit and vegetable market.
(FR) Mr President, on the agenda I am <unk> that we will be discussing a <unk> version of the directive on the <unk> audit of agricultural and forestry tractors.
I have the feeling that the Dublin vote requires us to discuss other <unk> issues.
We cannot leave an issue like the Treaty of Lisbon solely to the European Council.
We Members of the European Parliament can make a very legitimate contribution, especially when we know the ingredients of the solutions.
Firstly, the key issues must relate to a few essential institutional aspects and not to several hundred pages.
We need confirmation by a European referendum, with an opt-out for countries that do not wish to go down this road, and, as the President said, we need a very tight timetable - 2009 - otherwise the election campaign will be impossible.
I do not want to say to anyone that such a scenario is impossible to <unk> it is not more <unk> than it is in which the <unk> is currently working.
For my part, I am ready for my part.
Mr President, the Commission is currently examining complaints from certain private companies in Spain, France and Italy against cooperatives and the <unk> in terms of statutes and fiscal treatment.
I would urge the Commission to take note of the specific needs and characteristics of cooperatives when examining these complaints.
These are not <unk>
A Cooperative Society belongs to their members and profits are distributed equally and not simply paid to shareholders.
The European Union recognised the special nature of the 2003 <unk> Directive by the regulation on the Statute for the European Cooperative Society <unk>
I would urge the Commission to take this into account and to gain the gratitude of 55 million workers in cooperatives in Europe and further 163 million members.
Mr President, last week China called for an end to <unk> as a prerequisite for further discussions with representatives of the Dalai Lama.
According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, Tibetans would have to stop the attempts to <unk> the Olympic Games.
However, it cannot be acceptable that the repression of the Tibetan protests in March should be accepted by this <unk>
The Chinese Government has the opportunity to fundamentally change the situation in Tibet.
With a genuine dialogue without preconditions the Tibetan people will be involved in a constructive change.
First of all, a clear signal must be made, not least because foreign observers are left to the country to get a picture of the situation.
Thank you, Mr <unk>
Moreover, our resolution of 10 April in which we have said that we are calling for no politician and no politician of the European Union to participate in the opening ceremony on 8 August will be involved if the rights of the Tibetans are not guaranteed.
And I commend this statement of 10 April.
(HU) Mr President, if Pope Benedict <unk> spoke of the serious legacy of the long era of Communist rule, his words were only too <unk>
Especially today, because the execution of the Prime Minister and <unk> <unk> <unk> for the 50th anniversary of the day and we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the start of the brutal religious persecution and the arrest of <unk> József <unk> is the most important thing he is doing.
The bad spirit of this painful <unk> in state violence with <unk> and <unk> <unk> was <unk> by <unk> Kósáné Kovács, <unk> Members of this House, in their recent speeches here in the Chamber with which they <unk> European values towards Pope Benedict <unk> or rather the Catholic Church.
A few years ago, the former <unk> Mrs Kósáné Kovács, raised the <unk> claim that at the time of his leader, Pope John <unk> his leader, Pope John <unk> is doing everything he can to bring <unk> under his influence and control.
As Bishop of the Catholic Church I know that the Christian churches themselves have made a contribution to shaping European values in this European Union which have its roots in the <unk> democratic movement, and therefore condemn any <unk> ideology and <unk>
We have Pope Pope <unk> to the European Parliament.
(HU)
Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, on 16 June, the Prime Minister of Hungary, <unk> <unk> was <unk> in Hungary, during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and during the Gulf War following a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and his <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was murdered during the detention of <unk>
The body with <unk> <unk> and <unk> has been buried with the face of the <unk>
Your process was one of the most serious events and the greatest violations of the twentieth century.
<unk> <unk> was passionate <unk> yet he did not want to leave his country in the Soviet camp but to move into the free Europe.
This has become the <unk> of the revolution of the revolution and the politicians of Europe.
His moral attitude allowed him to become a symbol of freedom and a European Hungary, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> deserved to <unk> on 16 June 1989, when the Communist regime had already failed and Hungary was able to return to the family of the free European nations.
These events send out the clear message: freedom and national independence were the result of Hungary being <unk> after the end of communism.
The people who died fifty years ago, their lives were not <unk>
Mr President, I listened carefully to the previous speaker, Mr <unk> who was in a totally inappropriate manner in this respect.
Mrs Kovács is in the chair of the Socialist Group.
It is not here that it is not possible to oppose this attack.
I know that Mrs Kovács is a committed <unk> and a very committed <unk> for European unity.
It does not deserve to abuse any Members of this House in order to avoid any kind of <unk> that they may have in Hungary as well as <unk>
I consider this to be a totally inappropriate statement for the personality of <unk> Kovács and a statement that I am deeply <unk>
(FR) Mr President, first of all, I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative to provide a compensation for fishermen.
Although this aid is certainly not enough to solve the problems of the sector, it seems to me to be at the very least at the moment.
The current situation is indeed <unk> in one year the price of <unk> of 35 cents per litre has increased.
So the bill for <unk> is very high, and in my constituency <unk> de <unk> is very concerned and <unk>
In addition to the issue of oil prices, fishermen are particularly important to sell their fish at a reasonable price, and they complain about the unjustified profit margins of the <unk>
This is more than a <unk> it is a structural issue which we need to resolve at European level.
As we have seen, the <unk> has adopted a European dimension.
This is logical, given that fisheries policy is one of the oldest EU policies.
We need to help the fisheries sector in its modernisation so that it can free itself from the constraints imposed by the <unk> and to meet our commitment to protect the environment and deal responsibly with fisheries resources.
In view of this, I hope that the debate scheduled for Wednesday will lead to a resolution which will be useful to the European fisheries sector at risk.
Mr President, <unk> <unk> Juan Juan Juan Juan <unk> was made redundant two days ago in Singapore.
He has been condemned and imprisoned on several occasions in recent years.
<unk> <unk> Juan Juan is not a <unk>
His <unk> is quite simply that he is one of the leaders of the democratic opposition.
He is fighting for freedom and democracy in his country.
Since its last <unk> the media controlled in Singapore have begun to <unk> him by <unk> attacks on his person and <unk> and destroy his credibility.
We feel deeply solidarity for Mr <unk> <unk> and his supporters because they are fighting for democracy and human rights in <unk>
We call on the authorities to stop the repression of the democratic opposition and human rights violations and to respect the fundamental right to freedom of expression.
We hope Singapore will fulfil our urgent desire to respect fundamental rights.
Mr President, last week the Irish people met a democratic decision on the Treaty of Lisbon, which must be fully respected.
Although many of us who have worked or voted 'yes' to a 'yes' vote, I think it is important that we think about this result.
In reply to Mr <unk> I would like to stress that Ireland is not <unk>
Ireland remains fully behind the European idea.
We are fully aware that Ireland is one of the 27 Member States, but that is not just an Irish problem.
It is a problem for all Member States.
Europe has been in the past in a number of ways, but it has insisted on <unk> and wise leadership.
I would like to ask for the same qualities.
We are in unknown waters and I think it is important that we guard against <unk> reactions and hasty decisions.
In order to be able to cope successfully with the current situation, we need to think well and give lessons to <unk> only in this way can we get Europe back on track and fully assume our responsibilities to the citizens.
(EL) Mr President, the offices of the European Parliament in the Member States are the <unk> between Parliament and the citizens.
One of the key tasks of these offices is to inform the public through various activities on the events in the European Parliament.
It also involves inviting journalists to Strasbourg to report on <unk>
On 24 January 2008, I asked the European Parliament a question about the decision to reduce funding for <unk>
Five months later, I have still not received a reply.
Similar questions from Members of Parliament will not be answered either.
I wonder whether this strategy is needed at a time when the European Union needs a smooth process of the procedures laid down in its legislation and is beneficial to the functioning of the parliamentary institutions and the competent bodies.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of Members of the European Parliament to the expulsion of <unk> <unk> from Italy, which is in stark contrast to the commitments made by Italy under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, Article 3 of this Convention.
Why?
Because Mr <unk> terrorist activity is being accused and the European Court of Human Rights has clearly stated that every person accused of terrorist activity is tortured in Tunisia.
That is why the European Court of Justice asked Italy to suspend the <unk>
Despite this, Italy was in complete disregard of its obligations on 3 June.
I call for Italy to be reminded of its obligations as a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and as a Member State of the European Union and to ensure that Mr <unk> who has now been deported to Tunisia, must not suffer inhuman and degrading treatment.
(Applause)
(GA) Madam President, the Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty last Thursday was not directed against Europe.
Ireland's place is in the European Union which has brought social and economic benefits to the country due to its membership in both the north and the South.
People are concerned that the voice of Ireland and other small states in the European Union will no longer be <unk> moreover, they are concerned about issues such as neutrality and military affairs, the rights of workers and public services.
These concerns have been expressed not only on the streets but also in the opinion polls published during the campaign.
Another important issue is its automatic right to a referendum on future fundamental changes.
Some of these issues have already been raised in France and the Netherlands.
We must take these concerns seriously.
(HU) Madam President, I am addressing you as a Member of a country whose Parliament has ratified the Treaty on a Constitution for Europe as the second country and the Treaty of Lisbon with the support of all parties.
In this capacity, I would remind you that national egoism or nationalism today is the greatest threat in Europe.
We need to ask ourselves whether we should still reward those who constantly make further demands or should instead be <unk>
Respect for national interests is a fundamental duty of the government of each country and its Members in the European Parliament, but the European Union is not <unk> if no viable compromises are achieved with national interests and that their Member States and peoples do not show solidarity.
I therefore urge our Polish friends to join the other Member States and support the creation of the European Institute for Innovation and Technology in Budapest.
The European Agency, Frontex, which ultimately referred to its headquarters in Warsaw too, seemed to be in the race.
It would therefore be unfair if our Polish friends were not to react with a similar gesture.
Hungary and Poland are <unk> nations and there is a beautiful <unk> 'The <unk> and the Pole, are two <unk> they are fighting together and drink them together.
That concludes this item.
Revision of the framework directive on waste (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Caroline Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council directive on waste and repealing certain directives <unk> - <unk> -.
rapporteur. - Madam President, following your suggestion that there is no time for procedural issues, I will continue with my comments on the framework directive on waste.
In view of this <unk> this is a little difficult, but I will stick to it.
As the British press has recently appeared on this subject, I would like to draw your attention once again to my <unk> <unk> which I gave on the record and in which I have made my cooperation in the <unk> <unk> Board of <unk> <unk>
This company has a wide range of <unk> in both Britain and mainland Europe, and the primary task of its <unk> Board is to carry out independent audits in the installations.
The chairman of the Scientific Committee on <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the EU and a member of the Green Alliance belong to this body.
As many Members are aware, I appreciate this opportunity to experience experience as I am directly confronted with the issues and problems of the industry and its workers.
As far as the directive is concerned, it was a long and long road to this second reading, and I congratulate all my fellow Members who have followed me up to the end.
The issue deserves high attention.
Various judgments by the European Court of Justice on the status of waste intended for energy production were thus <unk>
<unk> had to be defined.
The two existing directives on hazardous waste and <unk> have been lifted and their provisions are transferred to the framework directive on waste.
However, the committee was not satisfied with these initial drafts and gave the directive a technical document, which was a technical document.
I congratulate my fellow Members on this result.
I must add that the mood in the Council was rather <unk> which may be due to our economic situation.
There has been a lot of resistance to our plans, and the Council has made very specific demands, but we have achieved the following <unk>
First of all, we have added the text to the text.
This is a very unsatisfactory result, because they were not included in the original text and have now been incorporated into European Union legislation for <unk>
That is the only merit of Parliament.
The new Article <unk> calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that a total of 50% for paper, <unk> <unk> and glass is achieved by the year 2020.
For some Member States such as Germany, this is an ambitious objective, but for many other countries this quota is a real challenge, and we must also consider that.
The same article also provides for 70% of the construction and construction of the construction and <unk>
The Greens and their supporters claim that these objectives are not <unk>
Perhaps they even believe that to be true, but - <unk> - they reject their own success.
The Commission has made a statement to help them and Mr Dimas will confirm this.
If the 2020 targets are not achieved, the declaration shows that the Commission has made this clear as a clear indication that the Member State in question has not taken the measures necessary to achieve these objectives.
With the conclusions in the <unk> progress reports the Commission can lodge a complaint against the Member States concerned because of failure to comply with the requirements of the directive.
It may be to the essence of the Greens that they are never satisfied because they are waging an endless fight, but they should also listen to what the Commission says in its statement.
Secondly, we have supplemented Article <unk> with new provisions for waste prevention.
This means that in 2011 the Commission will have to report on the development of the EU's agricultural policy and the scope of waste prevention and will have to submit proposals for waste prevention and waste prevention by 2014.
We have not managed to persuade the Council or the Commission to agree to the setting of quantitative targets for waste prevention in this directive, partly due to the lack of the necessary funding for these objectives, but with its amendments, Parliament has paved the way for a future policy that can include targets for the <unk>
The new article is therefore a significant success on which our successors can build.
We cannot achieve everything with this directive, but we need to hand over the issues that are addressed to our successors.
Thirdly, we have enshrined in EU law the well-known <unk> of the European Union for the first time.
We have been debating this for many years, but when we look at EU legislation, nothing has happened.
However, this will be done soon and we can make a small success in that we have moved the Council to agree that the hierarchy of legislation in the field of <unk> and <unk> <unk> has been <unk> according to priorities <unk>
Fourthly, we have reached agreement on the need to pay greater attention to the management of hazardous waste, which is the wish of several colleagues.
Fifthly, we have also ensured that the treatment of <unk> should continue to be given priority if a measure that would force all Member States to treat treatment and was desired by some colleagues was not supported.
The amendment tabled by Mrs <unk> and Mr <unk> which is intended to facilitate the use of the <unk> <unk> has received the support of the Council, as was our proposal for a new article on <unk>
Finally, the directive defines the minimum requirements for incineration and is classified as <unk> rather than <unk>
More could not be achieved.
All those who believe that we could have achieved more in a conciliation procedure are deluding themselves.
It is the well-known words of Jack <unk> <unk> who is as good as it is <unk> or <unk>
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, and my appreciation for her excellent contribution to the revision of the framework directive and the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their positive and constructive input.
With this directive, the Community is taking the first fundamental step towards creating a <unk>
It introduces a modern approach to waste management which considers waste as a raw material and at the same time includes clearer definitions, simplified rules and new, ambitious targets.
Thanks to the inclusion of the rules on hazardous waste and waste, this directive fits into the more comprehensive efforts to improve legislation and simplify the acquis communautaire.
The next step will of course be successful implementation.
Parliament's massive efforts and perseverance have been paid out.
It was not easy to convince Member States to accept the new <unk> and to agree to the objectives for waste prevention.
But we have fully achieved this objective.
There have already been doubts about whether the Member States will implement these objectives.
I would like to stress that, in view of the current quantitative objectives, the Commission has the opportunity and the political will to bring the Member States before the European Court of Justice if they do not take the necessary measures to implement these <unk>
Parliament has many other important points in the text of Directive <unk>
These include the <unk> of <unk> new rules for the separate collection of hazardous and hazardous waste and many useful information.
All this helps to enrich the Commission proposal and to improve the text, which will therefore be an ambitious legal instrument for future generations.
It is particularly satisfactory that an agreement was reached at second reading.
I would like to reiterate the constructive role of the European Parliament in this process.
This directive creates a new framework for waste management and a solid basis for other Community policies.
The European Commission can support the compromise package in order to reach an agreement at second reading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Caroline Jackson has a saying that I think Mr Nicholson has quoted a statement.
As I know her <unk> I thought he could also be by Jack <unk> but I am sure that <unk> will be <unk>
This is a great compliment for our rapporteur, and I congratulate them on behalf of our group.
It needs our support and trade.
We did not achieve what we had presented ourselves.
But we have made great progress.
Commissioner, it is now up to you to ensure that it is implemented and to put forward the proposals for waste prevention with your objective for 2014.
I know you will launch this process, and that is also important.
This is important in that we have already discussed a great deal of proposals in this Parliament, as I have already been in this Parliament, and we have dealt with cars, electric and electronic equipment, <unk> packaging and other <unk>
Nevertheless, the <unk> <unk> is taking place at a rate that exceeds our economic growth.
The fastest growing waste is growing in a number of areas such as <unk> and we therefore need to do something.
My country provides one of the worst examples in the <unk>
We pay tribute to the Netherlands, the leader in this area.
But we are all catching up.
We all need to strengthen the conditions of the hierarchy in order to meet the conditions of the <unk> we must meet the targets for recycling and the prevention of further challenges.
This should at least lead to better visibility compared to the past, which was characterised by our <unk> economy, <unk> society and <unk> policies.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Mrs Jackson and Commissioner Dimas have outlined the most important elements of this compromise which I supported as well.
Let me therefore make a few main political considerations.
I am always a negotiator and <unk> as a result of the fact that a <unk> compromise is also truly sustainable.
That is why, after the night of the night negotiations, I once again read the texts with <unk> heads of <unk>
Does the truth know why negotiations should end at night <unk>
Is an agreement that is coming about in the morning, for example?
That would be worth considering.
But in all seriousness - and I say this to our friends from the Greens and from the <unk> but also to Karl-Heinz Florenz, who, as I have seen - has once again tabled an amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which I cannot fail to support, if we look at both the compromise text and the texts of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have achieved a real result.
Are we really aware that the Commission proposal and then the common position have nothing to do with recycling.
Nothing other than a recital in which the <unk> has been mentioned, but without being defined more precisely.
They did nothing at all.
Now we have specific <unk> we have a review to <unk> with other <unk> <unk> we have the security that Commissioner Dimas has just confirmed to the effect that the measures that are planned to achieve these objectives can be dealt with in court.
That seems to me to be a very important point.
It is also very important that a political and legal process has finally been launched in order to oblige Member States to establish real <unk> and that an environmentally sound <unk> has finally been included in a binding European <unk> so that waste becomes the resource of the resource as a resource.
Quite honestly and in full awareness of our responsibility, I believe that rejection of this compromise and the introduction of a risky conciliation procedure will not be in the interests of European citizens but will transform and define the objectives that have been clearly and <unk> in a kind of <unk> <unk>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with this directive, we hope that we can reverse the trend that more waste produces more waste.
This document is the result of a number of years of debate, taking into account the real existence of two major groups of Member States in the countries of origin, the most vulnerable states and the countries of Central America.
The compromise reached is to be seen in this light.
In the directive, the prevention and recycling of waste is a central place in the directive.
In addition, the text makes the necessary dynamic to meet both objectives and targets for new <unk> it is a fairly balanced compromise that is achievable and realistic.
As far as the amendments are concerned, we do not think it is a threat to the general consensus.
As regards by-products - the article in the main part of the directive and the article on the <unk> - the critics mostly fear a <unk>
In the absence of an international agreement, there is a risk of risk.
It is therefore important to emphasise that the Commission will prevent this from happening by means of the guidelines of February 2007.
It would be very nice if Mr Dimas could assure us today that substances or items will only be exported to a third country in a third country if the conditions in Article <unk> are respected in the Community.
This applies to the <unk>
If certain waste is no longer regarded as waste, the substances or items that have been produced should be transferred to a third country only if the conditions of Article 5 are complied with in the Community.
That would make it easier for many Members to vote for the compromise.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs for their efficient cooperation for the benefit of the citizens of Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
I would like to add my thanks to Mrs Jackson because the debate could have ended without having reached agreement on taxes.
But I believe that the discussions have been characterised by excellent cooperation, even though we are not happy today - I wish we would be - and I would like to mention some of the reasons why we are not satisfied with the compromise.
We have supported 30 <unk> in order to seek a compromise on hazardous waste, the <unk> the by-products and the separate collection of <unk>
From the outset, however, the main issues for us were the adoption of binding targets for reducing waste and recycling as well as the contradiction against the <unk> of incineration as a method of <unk>
The final compromise does not include a legally binding target for reducing waste.
An inquiry into waste prevention is not an alternative to <unk> the continuous increase in the number of <unk> is not sustainable development, and without this measure there will be another increase.
Even if recycling and re-use targets were set at 50% or 70% and the Member States are legally obliged to take measures to achieve these objectives, the defined requirements themselves are not binding.
I am grateful to Mr Dimas for his <unk> but why was the text so <unk>
It should be possible to prevent these objectives from being binding.
<unk> from <unk> and <unk> which have a major <unk> and <unk> have been <unk>
Incineration cannot be regarded as a waste of waste and reuse equivalent to recycling and reuse of waste, which would only lead to further investment in incineration plants and directly undermine the flow of waste.
If this is not a satisfactory compromise, we have missed the opportunity for the EU to really take action and take a leading role in waste policy, which is absolutely necessary.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for her work.
We have all tried to improve the original Commission proposal, even though we have not always been in agreement.
Many people throughout the Union are going to make the proposal that incineration plants are now being treated as <unk> <unk> as long as they meet certain <unk>
We continue to oppose these <unk> of incinerators and have tabled an amendment to remove this point.
In the area of <unk> the final consensus that has been put forward contains objectives which could cause difficulties because it is only vague that Member States should take the necessary measures to implement the <unk>
Good legislation requires a more precise formulation of the objectives and does not allow the European Court of Justice.
We therefore advocate keeping the wording adopted by the committee.
The proposals on waste prevention have been watered down so much that their influence will no longer be essential and will not provide the Member States with support in stabilising and reducing their <unk>
The unclear reference to the <unk> directive leads to a harmonised system of harmonisation and indicators not yet enshrined in the legal text.
We can therefore agree to part of our joint work.
However, as far as other aspects are concerned, I think we need to table amendments.
Once again, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for her open and comprehensive handling of the shadow rapporteurs.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has presented a very excellent report as a recommendation for second reading.
I am thinking in particular of the prominent position of the <unk> the deletion of category <unk> the prudent handling of the end of the <unk> the <unk> for hazardous waste and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was the amendment to the promotion of waste incineration by its classification as a <unk> if sufficient energy is <unk>
The outcome of the negotiations reached after two months is no longer far from the recommendation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and that is not the fault of the rapporteur, but of the Council's rigid attitude.
The article on by-products has not been amended and the Member States can decide on their own <unk> when waste is no longer regarded as waste, with all the distortions of competition.
Furthermore, no targets have been set for waste prevention and the <unk> and <unk> systems have been significantly reduced.
That is why I voted in favour of the compromise package.
I hope, however, that tomorrow we will be voting on the better elements of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I am referring in particular to the amendments tabled by the GUE/NGL Group and the Greens.
The environment deserves us to go through another conciliation procedure, in which we encourage the Council to make the necessary improvements.
If we as a Parliament show strength in this respect, it should be possible under the leadership of Mrs Jackson to do more than is currently the case.
I should like to thank Mrs Jackson and the other shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation, and I hope that tomorrow will be a positive outcome of the vote.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support all the amendments aimed at the introduction of objectives that are essential for waste prevention in terms of improved recycling.
Of course, I also support the insistence on a clearly defined and clearly structured <unk>
It is also essential to rely on safe and comparable statistical data in order to achieve further progress in the waste prevention and recycling of waste.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we in Parliament particularly need to use the hierarchy as a <unk> and not just as the Council prefers to support as a <unk>
The directive must make it clear what criteria are based on possible deviations and, in my view, the latter must be part of an orderly process so that there is no ambiguity regarding the concepts of <unk> and <unk>
I agree with the rapporteur's view that energy from <unk> can play an important role in the treatment of <unk> and that today we are taking an important step in this direction if we take into account the European Union's dependence on unsafe energy imports from many other parts of the world.
Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that I also welcome the amendments to the <unk> Directive, which were initially deleted.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs <unk>
I am dissatisfied with the compromise, but I am not <unk> because Mrs Jackson has negotiated wrong, but I am <unk> rather than Stavros Dimas, with the Commission.
In the case of aircraft, industry and cars, the Commission is exceptionally strict and <unk> in the case of the <unk> in order to make every <unk> which is also right.
However, CO2 is no part of the waste policy.
We can save 100 million tonnes of CO2.
This is an enormous opportunity which has been lost in this document.
The second thing I regret is that we have become a kind of <unk>
We <unk> the inequalities in Europe and no harmonisation takes place.
We are describing objectives, but these objectives are <unk>
In the next 20 years, we will not be able to achieve real harmonised targets in Europe.
That is what I am concerned about in this report.
Twenty years - that is almost half a generation.
We should have been much more innovative and that would have been possible.
I believe, Commissioner, that there is only one big problem: that is Article 14. I would very much like you to say something about this.
This may be very complicated in a federal state.
It is about mixed or not mixed waste and how they are treated under the principle of <unk>
I would like to ask you to comment on this issue in your explanatory statement.
There is, of course, one or two people who say that we will get a large majority here, but if these questions are not clarified, some large countries will be very difficult to do.
Please bear in mind that we do not only have the reading tomorrow, we also have a third reading - and 64 amendments in conciliation are relatively high.
So, if you take the opportunity to explain one or two questions on these outstanding questions, I imagine that we will end up with a good result.
Madam President, at present we in Europe only recycle 27 % of our waste and almost half the amount of waste is spent on landfill sites.
This shows that our waste management needs profound changes.
The first priority is to support waste prevention and to focus more on re-use and recycling.
That is why I welcome the fact that, despite some debates, the <unk> has been able to assert its place in the new compromise text.
As regards <unk> the actual aim of the legislation, I do not think in the current version of the targets for the <unk> to which we have already agreed at first reading.
While a person in the new Member States produces 300 to 350 kg of <unk> every year, the old Member States are almost double <unk> <unk> kg per year.
So, first of all, the rich countries should begin to reduce their <unk>
Europe produces more and more waste.
That is why the measures set out in the compromise are not enough: we must set binding targets in order to put an end to the increase in the number of <unk>
I would therefore like to support Amendment No 48, which provides for the reintroduction of a target for the <unk>
I welcome the set targets for re-use and recycling of waste, but I fear that the new <unk> in which it means that the Member States are <unk> the necessary measures to ensure that the requirements are complied with is not sufficient.
What we need is concrete, <unk> and binding targets, both for budgetary and budgetary purposes.
I therefore recommend to support Amendment No 82 in order to ensure the implementation of recycling targets.
Having made these comments, I would finally like to welcome the report and to thank Mrs Jackson, my colleague, Mr Sacconi, and other colleagues for their work.
Madam President, the agreement reached is in line with what was possible and the rapporteur deserves recognition for the result achieved.
Sometimes during a conciliation meeting at <unk> a.m. a result can be achieved in the morning that would not have been possible at a different time during the negotiation process.
We are all aware of the need to reduce our <unk>
A British Minister for Foreign Affairs recently announced that he wanted to reduce his <unk> by 25% by 2012 and to reduce the use of <unk> by <unk>
He also wants to ensure that <unk> are converted into energy by <unk> <unk>
It is also intended to reduce the number of <unk> used to four species that can easily be recycled or <unk> and all packaging should be made with easily understandable symbols which make it easier for customers to <unk> or <unk> their waste.
However, all this is a question of political will.
The reduction of waste depends on political will and this will can be underpinned by EU law.
I believe that we could at least have been able to move the Council to the date for submitting the proposals on the 2014 gas pipeline by a few years.
Parliament has done a good job, although perhaps even more could have been achieved.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is a disappointment.
It is a failure of the need to do more for climate protection and to <unk>
We know that the European Environment Agency has risen by 50% by 2020.
That is why it is a very clear <unk> and a failure if it has not been possible to impose binding <unk> or binding <unk> which have been sacrificed to the pressure of Member States.
This is a very clear watering down and a <unk> against what would have been necessary.
It is also disappointing that incineration is becoming more and more <unk> and that the <unk> is being pushed into the background.
That is why we would have needed precisely these <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> this <unk>
I hope that, by adopting amendments, we will be able to improve something in this proposal and really do what would be needed - an ambitious waste policy such as that of the European Union.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but I have a number of compromises to <unk> which at least have been adopted by Parliament at the first reading at the very least in some respects.
I am also sorry because this deterioration has been imposed by the Council and because it is wrong and dangerous.
I say this from my personal point of view, because I live in Italy.
In this case, Italy is unfortunately a negative example of the <unk> because it has infringed the spirit and the letter of the European law which has been in place for a long time to <unk> from the reduction to recycling.
This hierarchy must be tightened up by safe quantitative targets - precisely to reduce and recycle - and not to <unk> as is happening in some cases so as to leave it to the field that undermines the approach that it is <unk>
In recent years, Italy, for example, has encouraged the incineration of billions of euros with billions of euro, with results which all of us can see as a success.
Madam President, all the Member States of the European Union have to contend with the energy prices that are <unk>
I therefore believe that it is both reasonable and necessary to consider waste as a potentially important fuel.
I am sure that this would be the first time that the two sides of the European Union would be <unk> and on the other, we would have an alternative source of energy, especially in view of the current energy crisis and the increasing dependence on unsafe external market prices.
That is why I do not understand the reluctance of some colleagues when it comes to the <unk> benefits of the production of waste.
I am afraid that some of my fellow Members have been so keen on their <unk> and <unk> dogmas to sacrifice the possibility of producing heat and electricity from waste.
I believe that this is a major mistake.
I would also like to say here that I am very much in favour of a definition of the concept of <unk> in the directive, which leaves no doubt that it is the production of energy from waste to recovery and not to be <unk>
This interpretation should be applied in agriculture in particular where there is a great deal of potential.
(FR) Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, on her excellent work, which reflects their full expertise on this difficult issue of waste management.
I would also like to congratulate her on the fact that she has shown himself to be a careful follow-up throughout the negotiation process and that it was possible to reach this difficult compromise with the Council and the Commission.
We have a new directive to clarify some points.
We welcome waste management and waste management and the ambitious target set by the Member States by 2020 50% of the total budget.
Waste management must be based on <unk> <unk> recycling, recovery and, last but not least, the elimination of <unk> and this <unk> must serve as a guiding principle.
It is also important that, as stated in the text, incinerators have to comply with certain types of waste, and only then can we only use incineration if no other method is feasible.
In view of this, I think it is very positive that the text also provides for very strict controls on hazardous waste and stricter traceability measures.
It is, of course, a compromise and we would like to go much further, for example by incorporating environmental criteria into the definition of recovery and setting stricter conditions for derogations from the <unk> and the question of the <unk> which causes problems.
Nevertheless, we must support this compromise, as we are only too well aware of how difficult it was and that a conciliation procedure would have the risk of failure and that we would delay the matter enormously.
We must realise that, in the light of the failure of our European waste policy, it is much better to agree to a reasonable <unk> solution, with the European Commission having to monitor the proper implementation of the directive.
We will see whether we can go further in a few years' time.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for my part, I am not satisfied with the form or the content of this <unk>
As far as the form is concerned, I believe that we cannot correct our work properly if the final decisions - which are more than just adjustments - are kept quiet and go far beyond the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and only a couple of hours before the vote on Members' <unk>
As far as the content is concerned, this compromise text is a text of the draft text, which does not contain a clear definition of recovery and no longer seeks to impose an ambitious reduction in the ozone layer, and unfortunately reflects the inability of the Commission and the Council to translate the extremely ambitious declarations made at European and international level.
No, I am not satisfied with our political inability to take real measures to protect the environment or to improve our health, which is why I voted against the text.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to pay tribute to the work of our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson and the rapporteur for the ALDE Group, <unk> <unk> <unk>
The issue of hazardous waste raises essential issues of traceability, the <unk> the uniform collection of information on the <unk> for a long period - five years for all those involved in the <unk>
All these questions have been dealt with rather <unk> which is more than regrettable about health and the environment.
As far as by-products are concerned, I am extremely disappointed.
I am not opposed to the concept of <unk> on the contrary, I recognise their importance, but I think that the definition provided by the Council common position does not offer sufficient guarantees and that it is at the end of the day to destroy the real concept.
Other issues such as the end of waste management and the recovery of waste seem to have been sacrificed in favour of an agreement at second reading.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs <unk> we are going to table an amendment that has already reached the majority of the House at first reading.
The problem is the following: in many countries there is time for uncontrolled feeding or the wild <unk> of <unk> not <unk>
This behaviour keeps the risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, for example.
It is therefore necessary for these <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> by appropriate practices by authorised companies.
The use in feed for pigs must only be authorised by the Member States if a <unk> of 133 <unk> has been carried out over 20 minutes during a period of 20 minutes and all other provisions of Regulation <unk> are fully respected.
I am convinced that the Council will adopt this regulation with the compromise by adopting the amendment by Parliament.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise reached is a step backwards compared to the text adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The original text meant that the 2012 target should be reduced from 2012 to the level of 2009, which would have had a real impact on the implementation of a period of time.
This objective has been abandoned by the compromise and leaves everything in its <unk>
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had laid down minimum requirements for the recycling of budgetary and budgetary <unk> which would be too clear - albeit far from being a distant - deadlines.
These objectives have also been reduced by restricting only a few <unk> and excluding the <unk>
Another negative aspect is the promotion of incinerators through a certain efficiency of <unk> and <unk>
This directive seems to be giving rise to strong interest groups.
The result of the Irish referendum has shown that either the citizens and their concerns are either on the side of the citizens or of their concerns, and that the <unk> is being rejected and the process of integration is being <unk>
Parliament must take seriously the thousands of emails of European citizens, who call for greater commitments and binding objectives, otherwise we will risk a further great opportunity to strengthen the credibility of the European institutions.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I welcome the compromise package, but I would also like to stress that this is an extremely fragile compromise.
That is why it is now important for all Member States to assume their responsibilities and not to search for <unk> which may remain in the legislation.
In Hungary, the separate collection of waste is currently 2% of the <unk>
I can only express the hope that the directive will ultimately help to improve this unsatisfactory situation.
In the last few years, more emphasis is being placed on waste management in Eastern Europe, with the greatest use of funding under the structural policy instrument for accession to the EU and the Cohesion Fund.
One of the most important measures is the creation of <unk> but in many communities programmes have already been set up for <unk> including those aimed at the separate collection of organic waste.
On the other hand, however, it is also clear that there has been no effective action on the part of the fleet and that there has not been any investment in this area, and that there is no such investment as a typical industry for processing <unk> waste.
That is why the directives proposed by the European Union are very important, not least for Hungary.
According to statistical data, every municipality could basically reduce the waste that it produces by half of its waste as soon as dry waste is recycled and organic waste is collected in the <unk>
However, the decision on new obligations must also take account of their <unk> and the costs associated with it.
For example, can additional investment be made in the same areas in which projects are already under the <unk>
Can the original Treaties be <unk>
If this is not the case, it is hardly a matter of whether there is any need for the extension of the <unk> or whether there is legislation on the reduction of waste spent on landfill sites in contracts with a period of 20 years to dispose of the waste collected on the <unk>
In addition to adopting this directive, we should therefore immediately seek opportunities for amending the existing Treaties.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.
Thank you.
Madam President, I believe that we can congratulate the rapporteur.
It has been able to achieve a proper result with the Council.
In particular, I would like to stress that the different hierarchy has been implemented.
However, there are also negative points which are actually incomprehensible and have been tabled by the Council in this document.
This applies on the one hand to animal <unk>
Up until now, we in the committee have established that animal by-products from this framework directive on waste are <unk>
What the Council has now done is such a bureaucratic <unk> which would really need to drive a farmer on the <unk>
It stipulates that <unk> which is processed to biogas is suddenly waste.
Do you know what the mean?
This means that the farmer must obtain permission for the processing of waste, that he needs to explain exactly what quantity and what type of waste it is going to be, and he must set the site down.
The by-products directive states that there are exceptions for <unk>
If farmers are to get the manure onto the <unk> it is easier than when it comes to biogas.
One method that we really want to promote is the bureaucratic <unk>
The second point is the question of <unk>
Until now, the <unk> - which is now being lifted - has been established that <unk> is being processed and is to be won.
There are large quantities that are being implemented.
Of course, it has already been stated that this should not apply if it is not economically viable and technically impossible.
Now it has been established that the Member States should decide.
Yes, are we now a European Union or are we again Member States?
So we are quite clearly breaking the market.
I think that is very serious.
Now to the question of <unk>
The local authorities are now determining what <unk>
Of course, the pressure exerted by the local authorities was very strong.
But that is the wrong way to go.
That is not the way it can be, and this extension is completely <unk> the market economy in this matter.
(NL) Madam President, I believe that this compromise is a good step forward in European environmental law.
However, I am not satisfied with the compromise.
Why not?
My <unk> Flanders, for example, is using the best waste policy in conjunction with the Netherlands and is <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> and therefore we consider the proposed <unk> and <unk> to be totally inadequate.
In fact, we do not see any incentive to be even better in the future.
We are also not happy with the possibility of incineration plants for <unk> on the basis of the <unk> <unk> which we believe can cause great confusion.
Nevertheless, I believe that the overall outcome can be seen and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Jackson for her enormous commitment.
We will support the compromise.
(HU) Madam President, unfortunately it is the case that the waste framework directive in its present form poses a threat to the expansion of <unk>
I fully agree with our colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, from the PPE-DE Group, that this proposal for a directive is inadequate in relation to the <unk> as well as the use of manure or <unk>
In its current form, the <unk> is unfortunately threatening to extend the use of <unk>
The report by Mrs Jackson calls into question.
The classification of the classification of processed substances processed in the <unk> is not clear.
If the directive is to cover the <unk> <unk> the production of biogas from animal proteins would make it impossible for us to achieve this, although it brings clear benefits from the point of view of environmental sustainability, environmental and climate protection.
This discrepancy must be clarified and, as soon as possible, we must ensure that the legislation is agreed on as soon as possible, and that is why we must adopt the Commission's position on the directive.
(PL) Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur for her realistic assessment of the growing <unk>
The <unk> of the proposed regulations is waste prevention and <unk>
Energy recovery is simpler, but it should not <unk> the <unk> <unk>
That is why it is necessary to create conditions for the <unk> system and to distinguish more closely in the laws from when, for example, <unk> is no longer waste but raw materials.
There is a need for better and more efficient technologies in the transport sector.
Products should be designed to make recycling easier.
We need separate <unk> which are adapted to the market that both households and potential users can benefit from it.
If this does not happen, we are once again threatening situations like those currently in <unk> where waste incineration is unfortunately the only option.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I thank all those who have spoken in this debate for their positive contributions.
On the basis of the text adopted, the Member States now have a series of measures to improve their waste management.
The directive contains clear definitions and principles for the <unk> which, I hope, will solve the current problems with regard to interpretation and will reduce the number of court cases and provide a sound legal basis for the function of the <unk>
The proposed compromise package contains a number of essential elements.
I will now deal with the most important points.
Firstly, the ambitious environmental objective of the directive is now clearly defined.
The environmental protection system has not only been maintained, in some cases such as hazardous waste is even higher.
The co-legislators have agreed a series of <unk> including clearer and clearer definitions of the concepts of waste, waste management, recycling and <unk>
In addition, the directive has been successfully incorporated into the provisions of two other directives, improving access to legislation and, at the same time, maintaining the high level of environmental protection.
A clear distinction has been made between recovery and elimination and the Commission has the opportunity to make a further distinction if necessary.
The fixed <unk> <unk> <unk> encourages waste prevention and the elimination of waste only if there is no other option.
At the same time, it recognises the level of flexibility justified by sensible considerations on the life cycle.
I refer to the importance that Parliament has given during the negotiations to strengthening the upper levels of <unk> by introducing targets for recycling.
If these targets are not achieved 2020, the Commission can initiate legal proceedings for non-compliance with the requirements of the directive against the Member States.
It is also intended to launch a thorough and thorough process of monitoring the measures taken by the Member States in order to achieve the premature achievement of the objectives and in 2020, when the <unk> are already in force, not only will it be checked.
This early implementation process will allow unpleasant surprises to be avoided.
Finally, the directive introduces a completely new dimension of waste prevention in which the Commission is keen to adhere to its adoption and implementation.
The Member States now have to draw up their national control systems and create the networks required for this purpose, which must comply with the principles and new obligations laid down in the revised directive.
Article 14 of the framework directive does not stipulate that private or public bodies should be involved in the establishment and operation of such networks, or in any way it is in any way beneficial to the ownership of <unk> whether public or private, and the related infrastructure.
The division of tasks between the public and private sector is an internal matter for the Member States and is subject to their exclusive <unk>
If there is already a network of <unk> and <unk> - whether in private or public or even combined - there is no need for further action.
With regard to the concerns about the lack of ambition for recycling waste from <unk> and <unk> my service will be the possibility of setting up such an objective as the primary task of the review in <unk> which is provided for in Article <unk> (paragraph <unk>
As regards the feeding of animals with animal by-products such as <unk> and <unk> this is regulated in the animal by-products regulation which is currently being revised.
This should remain so, as the framework directive is not the appropriate legislation for regulating the use of <unk> and <unk>
The question of whether the requirements for by-products and criteria for the end of the European Union to be met in third countries prior to the entry into third countries will be <unk> by the Commission.
As for the question of whether or not to exclude <unk> from the framework directive, it is stated that <unk> is not used as waste when it is used as a fertilisers.
However, it is waste if it is provided for further treatment or <unk> for example, by <unk> for the production of <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Failure to cover the waste legislation in the legislation on waste is a serious loophole in the <unk> because there would then be no legal remedy for regulating such issues as air and air transport requirements for <unk> <unk> and <unk> and other aspects.
Finally, it should be noted that the European Union should promote the production of biogas and the recycling of waste.
However, biogas and <unk> are not <unk>
They produce air and water and can lead to harassment for example, in the form of <unk> and <unk>
If it were excluded from the Waste Framework Directive or for the <unk> of certain types of waste from the Waste Framework Directive, such plants would not fall under the directive on integrated prevention and reduction of pollution.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Jackson once again and thank her for his excellent work.
The Commission is very satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations and can fully agree with the proposed amendments that represent a compromise.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I would just like to thank all the Members who have participated in the debate.
I will only reply to the contribution made by an honourable Member, Mr Davies - now also as a <unk> <unk> <unk> - to the <unk> in which he would like to occur, Mr Davies said that I would have given the Council too quickly.
I hope my fellow Members will agree with me when I say that I have not been able to give up too quickly and that there is no easy <unk>
Mrs Laperrouze will confirm that the negotiations with the Council are becoming increasingly difficult.
In view of the economic recession, the Council is aware of the fact that this legislation will cost costs and is therefore reluctant to accept Parliament's amendments.
We have decided tomorrow morning.
We can agree with the package of amendments before us and I very much hope that this will happen.
We could have a number of important amendments, for example, to <unk> which would mean that the package is doomed and we all go into a conciliation procedure.
It would be <unk>
Or perhaps some of us, perhaps over night, have a less important amendment or a motion which is considered less important by his applicants than Amendment No <unk> on which I await the Commission's opinion.
I do not think it is clear whether the Council agrees with any amendments to the extent that it will be insignificant and that is why I support the package without amendments.
After all, the package has to be important, otherwise the Council would have been so tough on this.
It is not a <unk> compromise, as the Greens are trying to portray it, but rather a package of <unk>
Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation - Caroline Jackson and the <unk> which sounds like the name of a band from the 1960s - and despite the good cooperation that we have had to get back to the conciliation procedure.
I think we should try to conclude this issue tomorrow morning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, 17 June.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - With the new framework directive on waste legislation, Parliament has now succeeded in establishing high and <unk> <unk>
This was also urgently necessary and I am now confident that it will be more and more effective for the future of Europe to be used throughout the European Union.
50% per cent of waste electrical waste and 70% in construction and electricity production by 2020 seems to me to be a very good objective paving the way for <unk> environmental and environmental management throughout Europe.
It is precisely because the Austrians are now separated from and <unk> <unk> I am very pleased that all the other Member States will now be involved in this and that we will move closer to the environmental protection of the environment.
We should not forget that waste is just as raw materials which can help in the fight against climate change.
Now it is said that the Commission's specific proposal is how we can avoid economic growth at the same time.
Water policy in the field of water policy (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Anne Laperrouze on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position of the Council on 20 December 2007 with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on <unk> in the field of water policy and amending Directives <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> - <unk> -.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that we are presenting at second reading today is the result of a compromise resolution that we have reached with the Slovenian Presidency and the European Commission.
For me, it was a real pleasure to produce a compromise with my colleagues from the various groups.
I had the good fortune to have competent and experienced colleagues who were well <unk> and were always present during the negotiations.
I would like to thank them warmly and also the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the advisors of the political groups and my assistants, <unk> <unk>
I am voting in favour of the term <unk> because we both have excellent cooperation with the representatives of the Slovenian Presidency, which gave us the recommendations of Parliament and with the representatives of the European Commission, which gave us answers to this proposal for a directive.
I think that the results of our cooperation in the <unk> which will be voted on tomorrow are clear for everyone.
I would therefore like to thank all those who have helped me in my work as rapporteur for this particular issue.
I now come to the content.
The Water Framework Directive provides for a strategy to combat the chemical pollution of water.
This proposal for a <unk> directive aims to ensure a high level of protection from the risks which are hazardous to the aquatic environment.
Allow me to make the essential progress of this <unk>
We have two <unk> <unk> the 'polluter pays' principle and the principle of combating <unk>
The most important aspects are specific <unk> an example - in <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> which are no longer simply identified, but now as an instrument for highlighting a problem, which means that the Member States have to lay down the necessary corrective measures.
The main concern of this directive was the harmonisation of standards at Community level.
It is therefore a matter of itself that the Commission sets out the guidelines for harmonising emissions, emissions, discharges and <unk>
We have achieved that.
We have also been able to ensure that the state of cross-border surface water is taken into account between Member States, or even from third countries.
Parliament had hoped to include many other substances.
The Commission is <unk> in the run-up to 13 substances which it <unk>
The compromise clearly stipulates that the Commission will have 24 months on the basis of scientific data on final classification and to propose appropriate limit values.
This is a very significant step forward, since these substances are mainly about <unk> free <unk> <unk> dioxins and <unk>
With regard to the sensitive issue of <unk> and <unk> the compromise, in the absence of a scientific consensus, provides for the Member States to monitor them in order to assess long-term trends in the substances that are <unk>
Members of the European Parliament were surprised that the proposal did not contain any new measures for monitoring emissions and achieved the compromise laid down in Article 7, according to which the Commission examined the effectiveness of existing legislation and the progress made in reducing the scope of the directive and proposing changes or proposed legislation or proposed legislation.
In view of this progress, I would urge Members to support this compromise package.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is one of the most important tasks of <unk> the protection of our water resources for our own benefit and for the benefit of future generations.
I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their excellent work and cooperation in drawing up this directive.
As you will recall, in the Water Framework Directive, the most important area of legislation for the tuna sector, further legislation in two areas is considered necessary in two areas as necessary for groundwater and <unk> for priority substances in <unk>
The groundwater directive was adopted at the end of 2006 in the conciliation procedure.
Today, the European Parliament must be at second reading on the proposal for a directive on <unk> for priority substances in <unk>
The directive lays down harmonised quality standards for 33 substances in the directive, thus implementing the concept of good quality water in a fixed <unk> which is based on the best available scientific data and knowledge.
In this way, the directive will contribute to a high level of protection for the environment and human health.
This is also the purpose of the <unk>
The Commission is determined to monitor the implementation of the groundwater directive and the Water Framework Directive.
It also wants to collect information on the presence and effects of substances that are not included in the list of priorities or on the list of priority hazardous substances.
It intends to adopt proposals for adopting further necessary measures.
In the course of the negotiations, Parliament's interventions on many important issues have helped to secure the ambitious targets originally proposed by the Commission.
This applies in particular to a number of key points: the proposed revision of the list of priority substances that are now directly linked to <unk> and will be presented within two years after the entry into force of this directive, the list of the <unk> <unk> to be examined following the review of the existing list and the criteria for the assessment of emissions, discharges and losses and for <unk>
I would also like to comment briefly on the issue of <unk>
As you know, the Water Framework Directive provides for the link between <unk> and <unk>
Most of the Community legislation is covered by existing Community legislation.
In addition to <unk> in accordance with the directives on the treatment of municipal waste and the integrated prevention and reduction of pollution - these directives were already in force in the adoption of the Water Framework Directive in 2000 - the Commission adopted or proposed more than 30 Community legal instruments.
I would like to mention some of them: the regulation on <unk> the regulation on <unk> organic pollutants and restrictions on the use of substances in accordance with the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances.
We believe that the Member States have sufficient legal instruments to implement the objectives of the Water Framework Directive.
Furthermore, the Commission will examine the need for additional control measures at Community level and, if necessary in the context of the revision of the list of priority substances.
It will also weigh up the need for a classification of certain priority substances as priority hazardous substances, bearing in mind the latest findings and recent developments in the REACH regulation.
Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction at the joint and particularly the work done by the rapporteur.
I would like to reiterate that the compromise package with measures adopted on this very important legal instrument at second reading has the full support of the Commission.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs <unk>
She is an excellent rapporteur and I was very happy to work with her.
I am glad that the Commission has expressed its support for the report.
I am not going to repeat the basic remarks made by Mrs Laperrouze and I would just like to make a few comments, the draft directive which is a <unk> of the Water Framework Directive is the last step on the road to a piece of legislation that ensures good quality water quality for the individual Member States.
Together with the rapporteur, the Council and the Commission, we have had a lot of discussions and I think we have finally agreed on a compromise package which we all agree with.
Like the rapporteur, I urge all of us to vote in favour of this package, because I believe it is a balanced <unk> the environment protects the quality of water for our citizens and the burden on the economy is <unk> which I believe is crucial.
In the context of the negotiations, we have had numerous discussions with non-governmental organisations and the industry on the basis of a draft which is excellent.
The proposal limits the concentration of chemical substances, dangerous <unk> including <unk> some pesticides and other dangerous chemical substances in <unk>
It is based on the principle of <unk>
The rapporteur has pointed out that the Member States can identify <unk> in which the <unk> should be allowed to exceed the relevant <unk> but this must, of course, be properly regulated and carefully monitored.
We have zones in cross-border waters which can be identified as <unk> - an excellent piece of legislation.
The Member States are asked to collect data, including <unk>
It may prove difficult to obtain the cards but we will clarify that.
It is planned to draw up a <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> but this is also linked to discharges and emissions.
There can now be a loss of priority substances, provided that the draft is covered by the Water Framework Directive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by expressing a final thought.
Water is the most important source of life - this directive is so important.
Even on the <unk> it is the most important <unk>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Laperrouze and all the shadow rapporteurs and the Slovenian Presidency for their work.
This is the last <unk> of the Water Framework Directive, and it was very important to reach a compromise which represents real progress in our objective of combating pollution and, in particular, chemical pollution.
The daily news shows clearly how much PCBs is damaging to the Community's water resources.
Mrs Laperrouze listed all the points in which we have made progress.
Of course, we would have liked to have achieved more, but I think that we have created a good basis.
We will simply remain vigilant because much will now depend on the Commission and we hope that it will be very ambitious in its measures to support the results of the scientific experts, with the classification of future priority substances and dangerous priority substances, the famous 13 substances that will be classified in very near future.
We will also be vigilant in ensuring that the current scientific uncertainty with regard to <unk> and <unk> does not lead to a permanent economic crisis which, in the long term, the European Union will have the obligation to understand better and improve its quality and improve its quality.
In addition, it is necessary to improve the knowledge of emissions and <unk> as well as to monitor emissions.
We will ensure that Parliament remains vigilant and I thank the Commissioner for his statement that, in addition to the provisions of the compromise on which we will be voting on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and, if there is to be some delay or doubt in the Member States, additional measures will be put forward in order to ensure that we actually achieve an acceptable ecological condition by 2015 in line with our vote in 2000.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as the rapporteur of my group belongs to my group and I very much agree with her <unk> you will certainly understand that I have reached the agreement that she has reached.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, perhaps here and there, in the package, but scientific opinion is <unk> the political will is not always strong.
With the words of the previous rapporteur, it is very much in the words of <unk> <unk>
I believe that water policy is one of the successes of European environmental policy.
We should pay tribute to the work carried out by the Commission for many years and in particular Mrs <unk> contribution to the Water Framework Directive seven years ago.
Although the cross-border aspects have not been taken into account, the collective determination to tackle the problem of pollution in both the past and the present has led to an increase in the quality of water which goes far beyond what the Member States would have achieved if everyone had acted alone.
The legal acts we have adopted are clear.
Environmental pollution is recognisable and <unk>
The demands for their prevention are <unk> and this legislation is taking us a step further by banning the use of various chemical substances, pesticides and pollutants which pose a threat to the organisms living in water and also human life.
However, we also have reports from the European Environment Agency that show that Member States are not implementing the provisions in many cases as efficiently and fully as they should be.
In view of the unanimous opinion of this House on the nature of the legislative acts and the positive <unk> of Europe in terms of water quality, we should also have the following words to the Commission: 'You have the possibilities for investigation, act and enforcement - please do so <unk>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her <unk> <unk> cooperation.
In fact, it was possible to obtain a small part of the positive outcome of the first reading of the first reading of the first reading, but it is nevertheless the case that we will be holding a <unk> event today.
Most achievements have been lost by lobbying from the industry industry and by influencing public regulatory authorities with the lowest capacity.
Today we are talking about the sad <unk>
Our primary objective must be the gradual improvement of the water quality of European rivers and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> in agriculture and the introduction of toxic fish stocks must be stopped and strict requirements for the quantity of priority substances permitted in water or priority hazardous substances must be <unk>
The weakness of this report is the lack of political will to examine further substances.
It has already become clear that the current system under which the list is to be examined and new is being added is too cumbersome in the best possible case.
If the precautionary principle applies to the precautionary principle, many other substances would have to be looked at, but this possibility is <unk>
Moreover, it is not clear when a substance is regarded as so dangerous that it will be banned completely.
We are now faced with many substances that are extremely dangerous, but the Commission is reluctant to ban it completely.
This is <unk> a substance is dangerous and is dangerous.
We must check whether the Commission is driving the examination of these substances or further <unk> and justifies this with inadequate <unk>
If that is the case, it must be given the data.
Some improvements have been made.
For example, the countries must now include <unk> and concentrations in <unk> and <unk>
Furthermore, it is not possible to wait for the Commission to wait until the year 2025 to examine the situation but to present such a review already in 2018.
Yes, we will vote in favour of this report.
We do not want to be satisfied with the step taken after the first reading.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, there are thousands of polluters responsible for the pollution of surface water and the <unk> not only agriculture and the agricultural and agricultural sectors, the mining industry and the <unk> but also the budgets.
<unk> where there are no <unk> we are leading more and more <unk> to our scarce <unk>
<unk> are sources of many toxic substances, and biological <unk> will not be completed with the <unk> because the bacteria will also be poisoned as well.
On the grounds of lakes and artificial waters, toxic substances are also <unk>
As you can see, this is the problem.
If they get to the seas and oceans they are <unk> the whole world, and that is exactly what is going on.
The waters of these <unk> are very expensive and there is no technology for that.
I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention once again to the thousands of tonnes of obsolete pesticides that our water has systematically <unk> and have already reached a great deal to the earth.
That is why our group believes that the directive should pay greater attention to <unk>
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) The aim of this directive is to establish minimum standards for a number of dangerous chemical substances in order to protect <unk> from chemicals and other hazardous substances.
Unfortunately, lobbyists were very clever in their influence on the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.
Now that this issue is at second reading, the good intentions have unfortunately been watered down.
One example is that only 11 of the 29 chemical substances that Parliament wanted to control are now classified as hazardous substances.
There are no specific demands for the Member States to comply with environmental standards.
Nevertheless, this compromise is better than the Commission's original proposal and is therefore supported by the GUE/NGL Group.
However, you will be assured that we will continue to pursue this issue in order to ensure that water is better protected in the future.
We hope for another <unk> if the time has come for a revision.
I have a question for Commissioner Dimas, who is here this evening: what do you think of if individual Member States want to move forward more quickly and continue to take more far-reaching measures than those laid down in this directive?
Would you accept that if individual Member States have more substances than the substances listed in this compromise, then we will have to introduce more stringent legislation than the substances listed in this compromise.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs <unk> for the work she has done in the negotiations with the Council.
I think we have a very solid compromise package for <unk>
I am particularly pleased that the concept of <unk> is retained.
I would like to ask Commissioner Dimas a question.
From the point of view of feasibility assessment, this concept is important, provided, of course, that the environment is not <unk>
The Water Framework Directive calls for a reduction in the level of treatment required for <unk>
<unk> are stricter than <unk>
surface water covers several <unk> and in practice it may be that the <unk> are quite close to a <unk> which causes pollution so that a <unk> may be in a <unk> and the extent of the treatment for the <unk>
Can Commissioner Dimas assure me that he will do everything in his power to prevent <unk> problems for <unk>
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for the very constructive work that has been done.
I would like to remind you that this is a compromise package.
It is a very good compromise that has been negotiated here, and it is a further step towards an excellent quality of water in Europe.
I would like to stress that Europe is the continent of the continent or the political entity where we respect our environment and set very high standards.
It may be that it could be achieved more quickly, but if you compare it with other regions in the world, we can claim that we have achieved a standard that is very high, and that we must continue to improve and improve it.
In this context, I would also like to remind the Commission that we should be able to sell these successes that we have clearly achieved in European environmental policy, particularly in the <unk>
The Irish referendum in particular shows that we have not succeeded in bringing these successes to the man.
Europe is very successful here, but the least citizens are aware of the fact that the EU plays a key role here.
It may also be that lobby groups have partially watered down the compromise, but there have also been other lobby groups who have contributed to the compromise that the compromise will mean that industry, agriculture and other polluters will have to make great efforts.
In this context, I should also like to remind you that water will certainly be one of the elements that will become more politically more important in the future.
I should like to ask the Commissioner to focus his attention on this future water policy, because it is precisely in the context of climate protection that some of us will have a great deal of importance in the context of climate protection and that it will be very important both in the economy and for people's lives.
Overall, the compromise is balanced and I should like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour of it.
It has not been possible.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs <unk> for her work, which has produced a satisfactory agreement at second reading.
<unk> surface water is of course of enormous importance.
There are reports of too much mercury and other pollutants in <unk>
This is not a matter for the health of human beings and the environment, and we therefore need to do something about it.
The result now before us is a balanced balance between environmental protection on the one hand and <unk> for businesses, <unk> and administrations.
The European Parliament has succeeded in making some improvements.
In the case of <unk> <unk> <unk> where increased pollution is permitted and the Member States have to indicate how to limit the <unk> in the future, they must be <unk>
Parliament is also following a forward-looking <unk> the substances that may be dangerous to be dangerous, must be included in a separate list of <unk>
I fully support that.
Otherwise, I would like to ask Mr <unk> question to Commissioner Dimas on the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>
We also need to pay attention to a series of measures, particularly near hospitals, especially near hospitals, and <unk>
We should not forget this important point in the future.
Mr President, we know that water is the most precious resource and we must not allow water itself by means of an ambitious water policy.
It is very regrettable that the <unk> which the European Parliament gave at first reading at first reading by doubling the list of pollutants to be monitored and the obligation for EU Member States to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is unfortunately <unk>
The result is therefore a missed opportunity to do more for <unk>
It is important for the Committee on Agriculture to establish a coherence between the various <unk>
We need the ban on <unk> and endocrine substances.
That is why I find it regrettable that the Commission is constantly organising a <unk> at the expense of health and the environment.
In 2006, the Commission said that it does not want to make proposals for reducing and reducing the priority hazardous substances in the proposal for <unk>
These should be done under REACH and within the framework of the <unk>
But what happened?
It has just been a report, our proposal here in Parliament which has produced coherence on the Water Framework Directive and on harmful substances.
Parliament has produced it and not the Commission, as promised it will do.
We are therefore calling for no authorisation of pesticides on the list of priority hazardous substances.
The simplest solution is not to allow these hazardous substances to enter into water.
(ES) Mr President,
I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on her overall work together with other Members of my group and with Parliament as a whole to reach an agreement and to find a consensus.
I am very pleased with this directive, which deals with several important issues.
First of all, as Mrs Lienemann said, sustainability is a process and the <unk> improving water quality and water policy are part of a process that began many years ago.
This process must above all be realistic because it needs to be put into practice.
It is much easier to adopt laws than they do.
It is much cheaper to legislate than to enforce them.
It does not cost anything.
However, the application means that businesses, farmers and local administrations must introduce the measures in practice, which is not always easy.
I believe that this is an important step forward, but we must remain realistic because, as we saw yesterday in the referendum, it is sometimes not easy to be European.
It costs money and effort, and that is precisely what we are investing in at the moment, especially when we consider that this is a policy that has been applied throughout Europe.
The whole of the water policy must be implemented throughout Europe, and therefore we are dealing with extremely complex situations and many elements, including with extremely important environmental factors.
I would like to mention two other aspects of this directive, which I believe are progress.
Firstly, it calls for greater transparency from governments.
Water has always been a <unk> issue.
One of our objectives is transparency in public information, and we are now serious about our commitment to transparency in public information.
The same applies to the indicators, including the <unk> and I would like to stress the importance of the health strategy for health.
(LT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and fully support her idea that we need stricter rules for the quality of surface waters and the effectiveness of the evaluation of Community legislation.
The small Member States at the EU's external borders are in a difficult situation in the face of <unk>
It is neither the wish nor the intention of the EU to hide behind a <unk> <unk> in environmental and other matters.
It is therefore equally important to reduce pollution within the EU Member States as well as in their neighbouring countries.
Amendment No 26 refers to the Commission's obligation to submit a detailed report on pollution from third countries one year after the entry into force of the directive.
In its negotiations with neighbouring countries, the Commission should be more pressing for further enforcement of environmental legislation.
This issue is of the utmost importance for countries that have <unk> river basins of rivers with <unk>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, <unk> is <unk> or <unk> as well as <unk> that was the headlines and also the <unk> when we launched the Water Framework Directive in 2000.
The directive on <unk> in the field of water policy is now the last important piece of legislation in connection with the <unk>
It is a question of laying down <unk> for priority substances and pollutants that ensure that our water as a <unk> has to be protected - yes, I want to say that the highest possible level of protection is the protection that is necessary and possible after scientific knowledge.
However, it also means that the protection of water is a <unk>
We will have to continue with the scientific research and results of the results of the scientific research and results in order to include new knowledge and, in line with current circumstances, always guarantee the protection of water and technology.
In the future - as has been done - the Commission will not be able to do justice to its mandate and will miss the time.
The list of priority hazardous substances must be constantly and promptly monitored and monitored.
The Commission's proposal for a directive has led us as a Parliament to take action and to propose a second list, a list on which the substances must be examined according to the latest findings.
This list should not be <unk> or <unk>
It should also be the opportunity to liberate substances from <unk>
Of course, such a list must not be allowed to be drawn up at the <unk>
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has called for more rapid and timely treatment of the substances that are already available to us today, which have increased risks.
Six months ago we were sufficient.
I therefore very much hope, Commissioner, that the time limits for 24 months will not be fully exhausted in order to ensure that <unk> can be implemented in a timely manner.
We will jointly support the compromise reached by Mrs <unk>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
The majority of European rivers have a number of <unk> of which the resources of the river are used and the related responsibility is shared together.
The <unk> which a Member State receives is determined by the <unk> country.
For example, the Danube <unk> seven countries, the <unk> six and the Rhine and the <unk>
This is a difficult task for us to face up to a great deal of cooperation.
It remains to be hoped that the adoption of this legislation will remove the <unk> which has been set out for seven years now for seven years.
At the moment, bathing water in Hungary can only be recommended with the <unk> <unk> which has been distributed to the images distributed among Members of this House and also on <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> is only a kind of <unk> and shows that something is not true about the current legislation because, if all the statutory limit values are respected and yet <unk> <unk> on the River <unk> have to be simply the same as the law.
That is why changes are needed, and I ask you all to support the compromise package tomorrow with your vote.
(HU) My colleagues have already noted that <unk> may be the most valuable resource of the 21st century, and that is not the case.
It is also true that the situation in Europe is basically quite good, both in terms of quantity and quality.
However, I would like to draw your attention to one aspect which has not yet been addressed, namely the fact that the <unk> and with her the <unk> of the resulting <unk> resulting from the resulting climate change result in increasingly extreme progress.
This means that we all have a long time to go across Europe, hot summer and <unk>
In addition to the environmental issues we have discussed, there is also a lack of a system for the management of the water resources that this water <unk> which is not the case in the current system, and which allows for storage to be used in <unk>
This concept must also be implemented in political measures by the European Union, as we can ensure that we can safeguard the quality of the market in Europe, while legislation should guarantee quality.
Thank you.
Mr President, in <unk> lakes and in the soil, water can be polluted during transport.
This danger has increased recently, since the droughts in southern Europe are now being converted into many oil tankers for the transport of drinking water.
In this area, there may be technical <unk>
I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that this transport is completely safe and without any contamination by <unk> hydrocarbons which, as we all know, can cause serious health damage to humans and animals.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, apart from the points I made in my introductory speech, the proposed directive also helps to simplify Community legislation on water.
You will recall that the Water Framework Directive already provides for the lifting of seven existing legislation from the <unk> and <unk>
The present directive removes five other directives and, at the same time, it simplifies the submission of <unk> within the framework of <unk> the new framework for Europe.
In this way, we will be able to base our decisions on a political and technical level of knowledge.
Furthermore, you have certainly not forgotten that Parliament has attached particular importance to the objective of eliminating or phasing out certain substances in the Water Framework Directive.
The proposed <unk> which will also cover maps is intended to serve all the necessary sources of information.
It will be beneficial to the Commission as a <unk> if it is checked whether it is being complied with by the gradual reduction or gradual elimination of <unk>
With the Water Framework Directive and its <unk> we have a stable, reliable and long-term basis for decision-making at all levels, from the level of <unk> and local level to the European level.
This is particularly important for the preparation of the management plans for river basins and the <unk> which will be presented in December 2009.
Last year, the Commission presented its first report on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.
The report also included an assessment of the successes and <unk>
It is now up to the Member States to fulfil their obligations in time.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that <unk> is available within the framework of the cohesion policy, cohesion policy and rural development.
It is the right and also the responsibility of the Member States to determine their priorities and projects.
Article 7 of the Water Framework Directive already lays down rules for drinking water and this compromise does not change the relevant procedures and provisions.
I would like to point out that the Member States have to report on their compliance with Article 15 of the Water Framework Directive on their measures to reduce <unk> and international coordination in the definition of <unk>
The Commission will also have no objection if a Member State wants to introduce stricter environmental standards.
In conclusion, the Commission is in a happy position to give its full support to the compromise package in order to reach an agreement at second reading on this directive.
On this point, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.
With regard to the problem raised by Mr Matsakis in relation to Cyprus to Cyprus, I am aware of this problem and I will answer this question later.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your contribution to this debate.
So what are the objectives we are pursuing with this directive?
Of course, the quality of surface water is to be improved.
We do not want to find a lead, cadmium, <unk> mercury, mercury or other highly toxic and carcinogenic substances such as PCBs in our waters.
Mrs Lienemann referred to a <unk> of fourteen days ago, which showed that PCBs was caught in fish that were then <unk>
We can no longer tolerate such situations and I can imagine that Europe's citizens expect Europe to be a strong sign of protecting our environment and our health.
I think that we can convey this European message if we respect this Water Framework Directive and its <unk>
Some Members have said that not enough substances have been classified that Parliament has made cuts to the first reading.
At first reading, we proposed 33 + <unk> as a whole, that is, 61 <unk> substances.
At second reading we have 33 + 13, in other words 46 substances, but it is worth emphasising that these are particularly worrying substances which can no longer appear in rivers in the future.
The other merit of this directive is that it allows us to review compliance with European legislation - I am thinking here of the implementation of the REACH regulation and of the <unk>
We now have an instrument to check this.
Commissioner, you have heard, as my colleagues have said, that the Commission and Parliament are on the train.
It has enormous work to carry out a large number of analyses and <unk>
I wish you every success.
In any case, we will continue to monitor compliance with this legislation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 17 June 2008.
Strengthening the <unk> of the European <unk>
The next item is the Commission statement on the strengthening of the European Union's external borders.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, thanks to the UN High Commissioner for Civil Protection, the EU has been able to make a huge number of <unk> in the last year in order to support the Member States affected by the devastating forest fires.
We have identified certain points that require immediate action so that similar disasters can be prevented in future.
Firstly, we need to have the lack of available technical resources for disaster response.
This was seen in the 2007 operations in 2007.
Secondly, there needs to be an integrated approach to the management of forest fires and to prevention, preparedness and <unk>
Thirdly, the work of the European Commission's monitoring and monitoring system is to be strengthened.
The Commission has already initiated a number of practical operational measures, including before <unk>
the creation and training of a network of <unk>
<unk> for national <unk>
A large-scale exercise in April in <unk> involving units from five Member States;
the setting up of three <unk> for <unk>
Resources have already been secured for the transport of <unk>
We are also working together with the Member States to create tactical reserves in the framework of the UN Framework Programme for 2008.
In addition, between 2007 and 2013, approximately EUR <unk> billion will be made available from the cohesion policy programmes for <unk> and response to various disasters, including forest fires.
Another EUR 1.6 billion comes from the Rural Development Fund for the renewal of the <unk> and the implementation of <unk>
Finally, in the case of particularly devastating natural disasters, we have the opportunity to provide support from the European Solidarity Fund.
In its communication of March, the Commission stressed the need for an integrated approach to <unk> which must include prevention, willingness to respond and <unk>
It has examined all forms of natural disasters and man-made disasters within and outside the EU and all the Community funds available for emergency aid.
In addition to civil protection, three other areas in the communication were investigated in the <unk>
strengthening the European humanitarian <unk>
improving the coordination of the coordination of <unk>
promoting interinstitutional cooperation, for example between European agencies or institutions.
We also draw up an action plan which will be ready in the summer and will include the numerous specific initiatives mentioned in the communication.
a <unk> in terms of the ability to provide material and technical assistance both for humanitarian and technical assistance.
In this way we will be able to identify the special resources available to them and which are particularly <unk>
the promotion of initiatives to limit the <unk> in <unk>
closer cooperation with the UN, the World Bank and numerous NGOs in order to strengthen the world market in the world.
Better use of science, technology and <unk>
a strengthening of the role of our agencies in the global financial transaction tax.
a more effective assessment of <unk>
There is no integrated European approach at the present time.
That is why the Commission is preparing a communication to examine the added value of the creation of a Community patent system.
The Commission will therefore propose concrete possibilities with the following objectives.
Our knowledge about disasters and their <unk>
the link between <unk> policy and <unk> for example, between planning and <unk>
optimise the use of Community funds.
In addition to this initiative, which will focus on the EU, the Commission is developing a strategy for reducing the level of poverty in developing countries.
Finally, the Commission has taken a number of measures to extend the EU's <unk> in <unk> within Europe.
First and foremost, the Commission's monitoring and information centre should be strengthened.
As we do not have a comprehensive analysis of the shortcomings and weaknesses of the response capability in the event of serious disasters, we are currently considering <unk> and new rules.
In this way, funds can be released for civil protection and capacity for European operations.
By the middle of 2009, the Commission will also present proposals for a European civil protection system in the field of civil protection.
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for its continued support in strengthening the Community's response capability in the event of a disaster.
This support is once again reflected in the draft resolution that is to be voted on in plenary.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
Recently, many EU Member States have been hit by natural disasters such as <unk> floods and earthquakes and the environment has suffered devastating damage which can only be eliminated in many years.
One of the <unk> of the founding fathers of the Community was solidarity.
This means that the EU should be able to provide funding for the regions affected by a natural disaster not only in coordinated technical support but within the framework of the European Solidarity Fund.
I have listened with interest to the Commissioner's comments on all the options for prevention and coordinated intervention, and we are now awaiting appropriate measures from the European Commission.
I would like to draw attention to a question relating to the European Solidarity Fund.
I do not think it is justified for the Council decision to be adopted on the European Solidarity Fund, and this decision should therefore be amended.
The reorganisation of the European fund will make an important contribution because, firstly, the EU will make a better and more flexible management of natural disasters in the event of natural disasters, and, secondly, citizens who have no roof after a disaster and live in uncertainty will immediately feel European solidarity without delay.
They will understand what it means to be not only citizens of a country but also of the EU.
These policies and measures expect the citizens of Europe and I hope that the regulation on the European Solidarity Fund will be adopted immediately.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a recurring <unk> either before or after the <unk> forest fires, the political agenda determines the political agenda.
However, this issue is becoming increasingly important, because natural disasters and climate change cannot be separated from each other.
And since extreme weather conditions are becoming increasingly <unk> scientists warn that natural disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and <unk> so there will be more frequent and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and always destructive floods, often occurring extreme <unk> and <unk> and greater forest fires that will be more and more difficult.
In 2006, the European Parliament adopted three reports on this subject and in one of these reports the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment proposed that the Commission should present a directive on forest fires.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission whether it does not believe that in view of the circumstances that have been described, and on the basis that a <unk> approach is needed - in other words, that policy against climate change would not be separate from <unk> - a directive on forest fires would be justified.
Moreover, the debate is taking place in the context of energy, the food and other crises that are all linked to each other, at a very crucial time.
For example, biomass should be recovered from the forests in order to keep them clean and prevent forest fires and, at the same time, generate energy from biomass.
Another advantage would be that grain would no longer be required to produce biofuels.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in recitals A A and D and paragraph 4 of this resolution, the importance of preventive measures is emphasised.
This is very wise because, as you know, it is always better - much better - to prevent it than to cure later than later.
In this context, I would like to refer to a certain type of <unk> <unk> the collapse of buildings.
The reason for this is a <unk> which has recently taken place in Cyprus.
Last Wednesday the <unk> of the urban <unk> in <unk> was suddenly <unk> and without <unk>
The weight of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> has been <unk>
Fortunately, the theatre was at the time of <unk> otherwise hundreds of people would have died or injuries.
In the days before the theatre was <unk> the theatre was full of children when several <unk> were in the House.
Two weeks ago, the <unk> of the <unk> in a <unk> house, and only a few months ago, President Barroso joined with other leading representatives of the EU, the President of Cyprus, ministers, Members of Parliament and many other people in this <unk> you all took part in the <unk> from Cyprus to the euro zone that took place in the same <unk>
It is a miracle that there has not been a huge amount of <unk>
It was only three years ago that <unk> were carried out in the building, which <unk> around EUR 6 million, but it appears that none of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> representatives of state authorities and other bodies have found that the 50 years old is no longer safe.
It is suspected that other public buildings in Cyprus also have dangerous shortcomings, but because of obvious negligence or ignorance or corruption or corruption of the competent authorities, or departments or private companies.
Other EU Member States may be in a similar situation.
Moreover, the majority of public buildings in Cyprus are not subject to legislation for <unk> <unk> unlike private buildings.
I appeal to the Commission to ensure that the European Union's buildings are checked on their safety.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, we can all testify to the fact that the number of natural disasters is increasing, because they are due to both climate change and the <unk>
In the resolution, which I hope will be adopted almost unanimously on Thursday in plenary and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Commission is being asked to abandon its delaying tactics.
My question to you, Commissioner, is that you want to work in the Commission to ensure that Mr Barnier's proposal for the establishment of a European civil protection force is adopted, as the European Parliament has repeatedly requested in its resolutions.
Do you want measures to make the Solidarity Fund more flexible and <unk>
Do you want to make efforts to close the serious gaps in the case of jurisprudence and the policy strategies aimed at destroying Europe in the event of natural disasters that are destroyed by the property of the Member States in the event of natural disasters, which are <unk> and more effective and more effective?
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we agreed on a number of questions to the Commission, and today you tell us that you want to present proposals in the middle of 2009, in other words in a year.
Our question is: when will the Commission finally examine this matter seriously and respond to the European Parliament's proposal?
What proposals can you agree to, and when will you <unk> them?
What proposals do you not agree with and why not?
If you are held up by the Council, which does not want to give you the necessary funding, or if you are hampered by certain people in the Commission, Mr Dimas, then you should tell us that to help you.
We do not just want to hear big words, we want to see action so that we do not have to complain about new victims this summer.
(BG) At the beginning of the evening, I have passed Parliament on Ahmed <unk> <unk> the face of corruption at the highest level, and the party for rights for rights and freedoms that it is <unk>
Now I would like to provide some specific information on forest fires.
In Bulgaria, it is an open secret that the group of companies that surround its party have been <unk> the Bulgarian forests for eight years.
This crime is the easiest thing to be done by forest fires, so that thousands of hectares of forest in Bulgaria fall victim to the fire.
<unk> a purely <unk> problem today is also at European level, because Bulgaria is given a large amount of <unk> for the <unk> in the <unk>
But what are these <unk>
They will be transferred to the Ministry of Civil Protection <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
According to the floods in Bulgaria, tens of millions of euros disappeared from the European Solidarity Fund.
I would ask you, Commissioner, and all Members to come to Bulgaria to see what form of solidarity <unk> <unk> for their own constituency and the <unk> for their constituents, the Muslim <unk> who live in <unk> <unk> while the money from the European Solidarity Fund is somewhere in the depths of the <unk> <unk>
That is why I raised this issue.
This is a serious crime against the Bulgarian environment and the European Union, which is literally deprived of its financial resources.
Whatever disaster the future of Bulgaria may be, the party movement for rights and freedoms will always remain the worst disaster.
(ES) Mr President, I welcome the initiative of the Committee on the Environment that we can add to a long list of the Committee on Regional Development in this parliamentary term, even though these initiatives are not always understood correctly.
In reality, however, there are some developments, including so many decisions, that our concerns were entirely justified.
However, it is sad to see that the Council is so <unk> and <unk>
The paradox is that issues related to the environment, regional policy and agriculture are subject to the finance ministers.
The national governments should consider the <unk> refusal to reform the outdated Solidarity Fund, despite the efforts of Parliament and the Commission and the clear public demand for such reform.
I hope that this summer we will not be affected by <unk> drought and floods.
I hope that the Council will not again be forced to publish empty <unk> instead of coordinating coordination and funding for people, while we complain about the indifference and lack of interest of citizens in the work of our institutions.
Some members of the Committee on Regional Development have tabled amendments to draw the Council's attention to the need for reforms and initiatives.
We will see whether the Council is able to give an answer today.
(ES) Mr President,
First of all, I would like to welcome the initiative of Parliament to strengthen the European Union's defence capacity as such tragedies are unfortunately becoming more and more frequent and therefore have to be a key task of our political initiative and the ability to act quickly.
We need to find a comprehensive approach to dealing with disasters, their prevention and <unk> so it is important to ask the Commission to submit proposals on civil protection in the European Union.
It must also be noted that the specific nature of natural disasters must be recognised as a result of droughts and fires in the Mediterranean and our instruments in the framework of prevention, research, the civil protection system and solidarity must be adapted accordingly.
We know that the Member States' resources to combat forest fires are limited, and so we call on the Commission to initiate measures to finance <unk> and thus increase capacities and supplement national resources.
This resolution must also call on the Council to adopt a decision on the proposed regulation on the Solidarity Fund in order to respond more quickly and more effectively to disasters that cannot be combated by Member States alone.
And not forgetting the victims of these tragedies that need immediate help and support.
We must not remain indifferent to this situation, which will be affected by many regions of the European Union year and summer year after year.
We must be able to react decisively to these tragedies and help those who suffer from them.
The future is <unk> and we in the European Union must act.
(FR) Mr President, it is really regrettable that we are once again meeting a short time before the holidays to discuss the same problem.
This gives the impression that we do not make any progress on a number of occasions, at a time when most of our fellow citizens have doubts about the effectiveness of Europe, it is imperative to show them that Europe can react if natural disasters, whether they be fires, floods or even <unk> people's lives and property and that, in general, they need Europe and that Europe is for them.
Where are we today?
Once again, we talk about solidarity and that we need a binding framework.
It is essential to convince Member States of the need for a genuine <unk> civil protection force, which is equipped with financial reserves and additional European resources.
Of course, we need to strengthen humanitarian aid by closing the gaps that exist with regard to the granting of this aid, and to strengthen the global energy supply markets.
We need a <unk>
As the Commissioner said, it is essential to train experts in the area of emergency aid for disaster prevention, with the experience of the Member States in the field of <unk>
Above all, we need to take preventive measures and we need to do so in a genuine <unk> land and <unk>
We need to take preventive measures and only then will we be able to prepare for disasters and to set up early warning systems, which is essential.
What about the proposal for a <unk>
I would like to see concrete results on this proposal.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, many politicians have complained the victims of the fires last year, but only a few people have been able to take their personal responsibility in view of the fact that these fires have not been prevented and so devastating.
Now politicians should take responsibility.
That is why, before the summer recess, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament asked for a debate in the European Parliament to be held in plenary with the Commission on the possibilities of <unk>
Commissioner, you said that EUR <unk> billion should be made available for the EUR <unk> billion in the period <unk>
How much do you have today, in 2008, for this?
How many and what governments have these funds <unk>
The Greek Government has unfortunately had to concede in its report to the Commission that last year it was in connection with the most serious fires in coordination between the agencies and <unk>
In the meantime, have you informed about what has been done in Greece against these problems, or are you distributing funds to governments that are most likely to <unk>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a <unk> of some amendments on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to take this opportunity as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and to give you my view on the Solidarity Fund and its review as rapporteur of the European Parliament.
Since the adoption of the report on the Commission proposal on the new Solidarity Fund by Parliament in May 2006 by an overwhelming majority in May 2006, this draft is in the Council's opposition to the new fund in its amended form.
None of the previous presidencies has included the new Solidarity Fund in its work programme.
On the contrary, the revised version is blocked in the Council by the finance ministers.
Thus, the new fund designed for the 2007-2013 period is not in force.
Unfortunately, the old fund, as it has been in its form since September 2002, has been <unk> with <unk> <unk>
In the course of tough and hard negotiations, we have managed to negotiate compromises here in Parliament that are intended to make this <unk> Solidarity Fund faster, more efficient and, above all, clearly defined.
The Council now wants to bury this revised version.
It is incomprehensible to me that, as a <unk> the <unk> of a number of Member States in the name of solidarity in the name of solidarity on behalf of some Member States.
We have improved this instrument.
We have extended it.
I cannot understand how those who have already benefited from this fund are now refusing to vote in favour.
That is why I strongly appeal to the Council and its decision to reconsider this and finally start the revised version.
We are a <unk> Mr President, and nobody knows when and where the next disaster will occur.
It is also your responsibility ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(EL) Mr President, it goes without saying that all EU measures must include effective prevention, response and <unk>
However, there is an EU involvement in the prevention of prevention, which is certainly due to <unk> opinions or some <unk>
The reaction within the Commission but also in certain parts here is quite clear: some believe that the EU should not interfere in this matter.
I would like to oppose this view.
Without prevention we will achieve nothing.
The EU's solidarity should not simply consist of President Barroso being <unk> by a helicopters and a cheque from the Solidarity Fund.
<unk> solidarity includes a comprehensive <unk>
Mr Barnier has developed such a thing, but it has still disappeared in the deep maze of bureaucracy.
We have made a clear diagnosis and we are now writing the <unk>
(HU) Under the previous item on the agenda, the majority of natural disasters in Europe are linked to <unk> drought, floods, <unk>
One of the causes of the problem is the traditional <unk> and the fact that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the water can be released as quickly as possible, just a few months later, in droughts or forest fires we suddenly see how useful the appropriate <unk> could be to absorb flooding or extremely high levels of <unk>
That is why a great deal depends on the fact that we have a great deal of work to do on the principle that every single product is a valuable asset that needs to be used for critical <unk> and in certain ways it could be a solution to the problems mentioned - that is to say, to prevent them.
It must be ensured, especially in the new Member States, that these tasks are included in Community policy so that we can develop it as a Community political measure using its financial potential, thereby reducing the damage caused by floods, drought and forest fires.
(CS) Although I am speaking as a Member of a country that will only have serious problems with fires if we get the full scale of climate change, I am aware of the importance of solidarity between the Member States.
Following numerous debates on this subject, I am convinced that as a former <unk> I am convinced that it is high time for a joint strategy for preventing and helping disasters.
For this we need capacity and activity-based management and targeted aid, which must not be just financial ones.
I also call on the Council, all presidencies and, of course, the Commission to do everything in our power to ensure that we do not sit with empty hands in this House and that we can vote on whether or not the disaster is devastating or less devastating.
(PL) Mr President, I am also one of the five people who have been called on after the <unk>
I wanted to say that there are two things that we can do against natural disasters.
In some cases, we can prevent them from doing so well for example, for example, but if these disasters have already occurred, we must concern ourselves with the people affected by it.
One of the measures is psychological <unk>
We can imagine people who have lost their entire possessions and their good fortune through floods, their home, and they continue to live <unk> but they have to suffer huge losses.
I know from experience that the work of <unk> is very important at such times, and I believe that it is important to ensure that this is done in such a way as to ensure that <unk> can take immediate action to help these people.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very positive contributions.
It is the Commission's declared aim to significantly improve the Union's capacity for disaster in the event of disaster.
The Commission intends to adopt an integrated approach with its communication of March and the measures that are currently in preparation.
First of all, we are looking at all aspects of <unk> prevention, preparation, willingness to work and long-term <unk>
Secondly, we are dealing with all forms of natural disasters both within and outside the EU.
Thirdly, we want to integrate all Community funds through improved coordination between EU agencies.
With regard to the points raised, Parliament and the European Commission are initially agreed to reform the Solidarity Fund.
Unfortunately, the Council rejects this reform.
However, the Commission is not willing to withdraw its proposal and hopes that the Council will be able to convince the Council.
In the context of the <unk> Directive, my services are preparing a communication on <unk> and specific legislation on forest fires.
The Commission was the main driving force behind the adoption of the <unk> <unk>
These are European standards for the <unk> of <unk> they are now transposed into national law and they are implemented accordingly.
I am a passionate supporter of Mr <unk> proposals.
However, I would like to remind you that unanimous approval of the Council is required.
We all know that there is no unanimity between Member States.
For this reason, the preparation of our proposals would require more time than we would wish.
I would just remind you that in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, a qualified majority in the Council would be sufficient.
We have funded programmes of the Red Cross for psychological care and further programmes are being prepared at technical level.
Finally, the Commission notes that in the European Parliament there is a strong interest in a key role in the area of consumer protection.
I am looking forward to working with Parliament and the Council in defining the limits of subsidiarity in order to promote and develop the European dimension in the field of climate change.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 June 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The forest fires in Greece, Italy and Spain in summer 2007 and the floods in Romania and Britain have led to increased demands for improving the efficiency of the Union's response capability in the event of disaster.
disasters linked to climate change are becoming more and more frequent and, therefore, multilateral and coordinated responses are needed to mobilise all available resources in order to mobilise all the resources available to mobilise efficiency, efficiency and <unk>
Strengthening the Monitoring and Information Centre <unk> improving the capacity of European civil protection and better coordination between the UN and the Red Cross with regard to the provision of humanitarian aid is part of the measures proposed by the Commission which will help to increase the EU's capacity for disaster in the event of disaster.
The intention is also to set up a European network for the <unk> system and to establish early warning systems and the use of the European emergency telephone <unk> which is not sufficiently known in all Member States.
In Romania, only 30% of the population knows that this number can be chosen in any EU country in any EU country, and the national authorities must continue their efforts to spread these numbers in order not only to respond quickly to climate change problems.
1 July 2008 <unk> Customs Union
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the Customs Union on 1 July 2008.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, when we talk about international trade or European integration, we must not overlook customs duties that are responsible at the external borders of the European Union for the proper implementation of all measures and thus have a dual function today: facilitation of trade and the protection of European citizens and the environment.
Over the last 40 years, European customs authorities have made a great effort to cooperate effectively as well as a single authority.
They have often played a pioneering role in European integration.
It is a good thing that a policy that is hardly in the headlines has nevertheless succeeded in taking a <unk> approach to both economic development and the integration of the Community.
Today, customs has a very important and difficult task which is unfortunately not appreciated by the public as it should be.
However, the proper work of customs authorities is the basis for the success of our internal market and the free movement of goods, persons, capital and services.
Customs duties affect the real core of Community activity and affect the daily lives of our citizens, if the people are often unaware of this.
In order to increase our citizens' awareness of the important role of the customs union, I have launched an EU-wide <unk> <unk> on the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
The customs authorities of the Member States welcomed this idea.
Last week, I visited three important <unk> at the EU's external borders - the port of <unk> airport in Frankfurt and the <unk> <unk> <unk> - with the aim of paying tribute to the daily work and the high motivation of our customs officials.
This is also the subject of a <unk> which is now available to the media so that they will inform the public in the coming months.
Let me come back to the core issues and to come back to the fact that the customs duties today have five strategic <unk>
Firstly, the protection of the financial interests of the Community and its members.
In 2007, the total amount of money paid into the EU budget amounted to EUR <unk> billion, which is 16% of the Community budget.
The second task is to facilitate legitimate trade and support the competitiveness of European <unk> the modernisation of the Community Customs Code and the introduction of electronic customs are two instruments that serve that purpose.
The latest concrete measure was the introduction of the concept of <unk> economic operators by 1 January 2008.
Thirdly, through the control of the <unk> used for international goods, customs has to guarantee the protection of our citizens against terrorists, drugs and counterfeit products and counterfeit products, which can also pose a threat to the health and lives of our people.
The fourth task is to develop and deepen cooperation between the customs authorities of the Member States, between customs and other authorities and between customs and the economy.
The fifth area is cooperation between the European Union and third countries - cooperation with other <unk> in the field of piracy and terrorism as with the USA.
Our approach is based on exchange of information, cooperation in risk analysis and the mutual recognition of security measures, the results of security checks and security measures, but also cooperation with the countries of origin, counterfeit products and counterfeiting of counterfeit products such as China, because 60% of the population is there.
In 2005, we signed an agreement on customs cooperation between customs authorities and a joint committee for cooperation in the customs area which <unk> each year.
Last year there was a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> between European and Chinese ports and recently we began to prepare an action programme that was to be signed at the December summit in December.
Such cooperation is also necessary with India, Turkey, the United Arab <unk> and other countries.
Since 1993, supplies have been free between all Member States as soon as they have been released by the national <unk>
This means that customs will only have a unique opportunity to control goods and to <unk>
This means that the customs union is as strong as its <unk>
This means that it would be a good thing for dealers to find out what type of controls they are going to carry out less closely or intensively and then <unk>
This illustrates the particular responsibility of the customs authorities of the Member States who have external borders.
In view of the ever-increasing increase in international trade and responsibility in combating counterfeiting, customs will continue to have a great deal to do.
The following figures are to cover the scope of the work in 2007, and <unk> million <unk> that is to say, 5.5 <unk> million tonnes of <unk> and 3 million tonnes of <unk> have been identified and 43 cases of <unk> have been identified and <unk> million counterfeit and counterfeit products are <unk>
We can only do justice to the dual role that customs must play today if we rethink our working methods.
This means, for example, that we must move from the current <unk> procedure to the implementation of the procedures and controls on a <unk> procedure which focuses on internal control systems and the management of economic operators.
This does not mean, of course, that the control of individual supplies will be <unk> instead, these controls will be based on risk analysis.
Such a new approach is based on new working and working conditions and a common strategy of risk management for all EU customs authorities.
It also provides the Member States with a platform for drawing up an appropriate operational structure which will ensure an efficient functioning of the Customs Union.
The new working methods also include the fact that all national customs authorities are working with qualified staff and are equipped with the necessary skills and resources that enable them to maintain and improve their efficiency and effectiveness.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission recommended in its communication on a strategy for the further development of the Customs Union that a strategic action plan should be drawn up.
This long-term planning should enable the national authorities to recover their needs for resources, skills and equipment so that the development of all 27 Member States can take place in a coordinated and harmonised way.
This consistent monitoring process will also enable the new measures to be implemented in the future.
On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union, I would ask you to support the Commission's initiative for a strategy for the further development of the Customs Union.
I am glad that the resolution that is to be voted on on Thursday will take into account the Commission's ideas on the <unk> of the Customs Union to deepen cooperation and address aspects of security and improvement in efficiency, effectiveness and benefits for the internal market.
However, I do not wish to end my speech without thanking the European Parliament for having always supported customs all over the years.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to begin by paying tribute to the Commissioner for his commitment in the Commission to the <unk> programme.
I would also like to stress that this evening we are not only having a great opportunity which, as he has pointed out, the Commission and all the customs authorities of the Member States should pay tribute to this 40th anniversary, but also to take advantage of this opportunity to look forward.
I can assure him that the strategy he has mentioned will receive full support from our side of this House.
The resolution shows that we have called on the Member States in particular to declare their support and to provide the necessary resources for this very important project.
The Commissioner pointed out in his speech that the customs authorities are the silent heroes of the internal market, but the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will certainly not forget them.
As he will be aware, we have a great deal of interest in the dossiers, but it is not <unk> as he last week, we regularly visit in our missions in the European Union and now also in other places, especially recently in China, the <unk> to develop an understanding of your priorities and the problems that they have to resolve on the ground, so we are well acquainted with the issue.
I would like to draw attention to a number of aspects that we should bear in mind.
I believe that one of our common tasks is to ensure closer cooperation between companies and customs in the fight against counterfeiting and illegal products.
Customs needs information so that it can stop supplies.
Customs workers need <unk> support.
I believe that companies are not sufficiently aware of the importance of sending such information.
Secondly, in view of the growing <unk> in particular, we must ask the Member States to examine seriously whether they have the resources to deal with the necessary resources in order to deal with a very wide range of products and to examine counterfeit products and products that are to deal with the <unk>
Thank you, Commissioner, for what you are doing in this area.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as we see today that the citizens of the European Union are becoming increasingly <unk> it is particularly important that we celebrate these days that are <unk>
It is precisely these 40 years of customs union that are a remarkable <unk> you have said it yourself, Commissioner, because forty years ago the steps towards integration, the basis for the internal market and the free movement of people, goods and services have been put in place.
I think it is important that we keep telling the citizens what they have from the European Union and what we have achieved in this connection.
That is why I would like to say something very positive about what has happened here, because this really is a good thing.
The work you have mentioned with China and the European Union that you have mentioned, these are important steps for our economy, but also for our consumers and consumers in the European Union, for we want safe products and safe services that we can move forward.
That is very important.
In our last directives we have now put forward a framework for customs union, including the modern ones, by introducing electronic customs duties.
I think that is also <unk>
If we succeed in making such positive aspects of policy in the European Union, the citizens made clear what they have from the European Union, then we will be able to bring them back to the European Union.
That is what we should do together.
Commissioner, thank you very much for the work you have done in this context in the European Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when Europe has difficulties to overcome difficulties, there is an increase in the <unk> of the <unk> anniversary of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
Between 1968 and 2008, customs served as an example of imagination and <unk>
You probably remember the closure of the border agreements between the Member States in 1993.
The customs authorities have been able to organise their workforce in a modern way.
They have a complex role to play because they must respond to global challenges.
While they ensure that the European Union and its citizens are safe and that the <unk> is safe, they must also strike the right balance between controls on the one hand and facilitating legal trade to improve Europe's competitiveness on the other.
In order to deal with these challenges, customs authorities have been radically <unk> thanks to a new <unk> which is both simpler and more comprehensive, as it is based on new technologies that will enable a <unk> working environment and cooperation based on cooperation.
This cooperation based on customs union must apply both to international organisations such as the WTO and the <unk> and to new administrations and businesses.
The results of this cooperation are particularly evident in the confiscation of counterfeiting.
Unfortunately, international cooperation is set limits, and at the moment we can only regret the unilateral decision of the <unk> on the 100% <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
The customs administrations need our support in order to start realistic discussions.
We must pay attention to initiatives announced in the strategy for the future of the Customs Union, and to be prepared to support any measure that makes it more efficient, particularly in the fight against counterfeiting and organised crime.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 40 years of customs union, Mrs Gebhardt referred to it, is an element that the citizens <unk> that the European Union has played a part in what it promised forty years ago.
Over these years, and my group, Commissioner, has in the past few months supported all the amendments you have put to the European Parliament, the financial interests of the European Union and its Member States are considerably better protected than the Member States could have done.
It has made investments from one Member State to another in the Member States, as the Member States would not have <unk>
We have been able to make a significant contribution to the modernisation of the Customs Code and the electronic communications systems which you have mentioned, in order to make these investments even more transparent.
However, it must be said that the cost of this conversion has been <unk> with companies.
I believe that this is a major challenge in the coming years.
That is why, Commissioner, I believe that it is important that your strategy addresses these new challenges efficiently and effectively and provides answers.
In my constituency - you know this - there is a problem with <unk> at the border with Switzerland.
I hope that we will be able to resolve the many small and medium-sized enterprises that are making every day for businesses as constructively as we can, as we have done in the past.
Customs will have to take much more account of the security interests of the European Union over the next few years - and this is the challenge to which your strategy will have to give answers.
Of course, it is also a matter of protecting counterfeit products and <unk> but it is increasingly important to link this issue to the challenges of global terrorism even more closely in the context of global terrorism.
Global trade, Mrs <unk> pointed out that it is becoming increasingly important to negotiate at WTO level as to how customs can effectively bring about the protection of external borders.
My final point is that the question of the transatlantic internal market does not seem to be useful in our view as a <unk>
You continue to succeed.
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, whose competence is also covered by customs policy, I am very pleased to be able to speak in this debate on the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
As has already been emphasised, the <unk> of our work in the customs area attaches great importance to the pragmatic and practical nature of the European Union's activities.
The customs union will undoubtedly contribute to improving the competitiveness of the European economy by simplifying the rules for companies and legitimate traders and abolishing unnecessary rules.
ECU 175 million will be dealt with each year and an average of <unk> takes only two minutes.
But much remains to be done.
SMEs must be given greater support in order to minimise the difficulties associated with trade in Europe.
A <unk> working environment for the transport sector, a one-stop shop and a single one-stop shop will facilitate the work and support SMEs but these demands must be rigorously implemented by Member States if we want to succeed.
This is also an opportunity to include and intensify our fight against the influx and flood of counterfeiting and piracy.
<unk> products and falsified medicines are not only detrimental to European businesses, but are a serious and persistent threat to the lives and safety of our consumers, and this is a matter of great concern to the Committee on Consumer Protection.
So, by working together with third countries, and in particular China, we want to ensure that dangerous and illegal goods are <unk> but ultimately we must ensure that our customs union functions better.
The Member States are called on this evening to meet their responsibilities in the implementation and enforcement of legislation and to provide appropriate resources for them.
Commissioner, you are assured that we will continue to work with you to improve customs union as a cornerstone of the internal market and, of course, as a central element of the proper functioning and success of the EU economy.
We need to make sure that our 27 Member States are closer to each other, exchange information and create a Europe in which legitimate companies can operate better and more smoothly and that we are hard hit by the serious problem of the counterfeit articles and the <unk> which are now increasingly on our market.
(PL) Mr President, the customs union is an indispensable part of the European Union's internal market, which cannot function properly until the common principles are applied to the EU's external borders.
The customs union has not only the obvious function of imposing customs duties but also plays an important role in protecting the health and safety of our citizens.
In the last few months we have spent a great deal of time in Parliament discussing issues such as <unk> especially the safety of toys and toys.
We all have a lot of goods that meet the requirements set out and, in particular, no threat to our health.
I would like to remind you that not only are exclusive and expensive products of <unk> <unk> but also <unk> and everyday products, such as food or medicines.
Many of these products come from third countries to the European internal market.
The scale of this problem shows the statistics.
In 2007, customs authorities have <unk> around 128 million counterfeit products.
That was 70% more compared with 2005.
It was a rise of <unk>
Of course, this increase can have different causes.
It may be that larger quantities of counterfeiting enter the EU, but also because customs authorities are making better use of the <unk>
Let us not forget that standards alone are not enough if there are no effective controls at our borders, especially if the controls are not carried out in a uniform manner at all our external borders.
If we want to combat the influx of counterfeit goods into the EU, we need greater cooperation between customs authorities and the supervisory authorities of the Member States, but also better cooperation with customs authorities in third countries.
This improved cooperation must be accompanied by <unk> change.
That is why it is very important that the customs authorities throughout the European Union have the necessary equipment with which they can fulfil their tasks.
(CS) 40 years ago the customs union was the key to European prosperity because it was the way to create the internal market.
Today we are faced with the liberalisation of trade in new problems.
We know that only 0.5% of the large foreign imports can be controlled in European ports and that there is a third container in each third container <unk>
There is another danger of goods that do not meet our technical and safety standards.
I would like to stress that we need to protect European consumers from such goods more effectively.
A more effective vote requires the strict implementation of new, <unk> legislation, which our great gift in view of the anniversary of the Customs Union is <unk>
In addition, we have enshrined in our legislation the right to eliminate dangerous goods and counterfeit goods.
This is a great deal of work for customs officers and it is a great <unk>
There are still many other ways of <unk> closer cooperation with businesses, more effective coordination between Member States on <unk> and the latest option of cooperation with third countries.
We also hope that we have succeeded in improving the conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.
(PL) Mr President, the Customs Union created on 1 July 1968 was the first step towards strengthening the economic integration of the six Member States.
We can appreciate them as a success in the history of European integration.
When we celebrate the <unk> anniversary of the customs union, we should mention that it is an example of effective cooperation in a community with 27 Member States because, after all, there is not only a <unk> but 20 national customs authorities with different degrees of <unk> and different <unk> which are based on the common European policy and within the legal framework that the current rules and procedures are supposed to apply.
The customs administrations of the 27 Member States must work as a <unk>
Forty years ago, it was the aim of the Customs Union to abolish customs duties at internal borders between Member States and to implement the idea of the common market.
Today, the customs authorities are protecting the external borders of the European Union and taking measures to combat smuggling in order to combat smuggling and to fulfil other tasks that the European Commission also - and I would like to congratulate the Commissioner - in its April 2008 strategy on the further development of the Customs Union.
Mr President, the customs union is a wonderful thing, but it would be nice if all the countries concerned would stick to them.
I am thinking, first of all, of Turkey, which, despite the great pressure exerted by the EU on the country, continues to apply or ratify the Ankara Protocol, which is subject to virtually an embargo on the entire aviation and air transport agreement with Cyprus.
I ask you why the EU is allowing Turkey to make our rules and regulations a <unk>
Why is this unacceptable behaviour of Turkey?
Why does the Commission not consider Turkey to be fully implemented or excluded from it by the <unk>
How long will we allow this <unk> and absurd behaviour to be taken by a country that is to be integrated into the European Union and would like it to be <unk>
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to pay tribute to your work and to your administration on this subject, because it is a credit to the European Union.
I would also like to thank my fellow Members and my group for supporting a proposed amendment on the need to take into account the difficulties faced by the application of <unk> and <unk> as one of the biggest non-tariff barriers to trade.
However, I think we must go beyond the cooperation proposed in the resolution.
At a time when the Treaty of Lisbon proposes the protection of citizens as one of the Union's objectives and the WTO has great difficulties, we must go further because the <unk> as the Commissioner has already said, are alarming and continue to jeopardise our health, security and the economy.
It is time to go a step further and take into consideration a merger between customs authorities which goes far beyond the <unk> cooperation that is clearly coming to light today.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, allow me first of all to thank you for the very interesting debate we have just had.
I have listened carefully to your comments because they are very useful for me and the Commission - and also the <unk> - as they take account of the political priorities defined by the European Parliament.
Your express recognition and support for the work of the Customs Union has been very <unk> I can assure you that it will continue.
What guarantees do we have?
The guarantees are that we have the instruments, the strategy and the legal basis, the modernised Community Customs Code including rules and procedures that facilitate legitimate trade and protect the internal market, safety, health and the lives of our citizens.
We have a very comprehensive network for the electronic communications network and we also have a very extensive network of cooperation with the customs authorities of the Member States, cooperation with other law enforcement authorities and cooperation with companies - and I would like to say to Mr Harbour - I would like to say that last week I had the opportunity to obtain information on the <unk> <unk> which is the focus of falsified medicines when we are now <unk> the various categories of counterfeit medicinal products, which are undoubtedly the <unk>
I am pleased to inform you that the customs authorities and the association of the pharmaceutical companies in Hungary, the country in which I was best hit by a few days ago, have reached an agreement on the prevention of counterfeit market access to the market.
We are also working together with international organisations and third countries such as China, and now that we are working for more than three years on this portfolio and regular consultations with the Chinese authorities, I can say that there are certainly improvements in the Chinese position.
Our Chinese partners are today more concrete and <unk> they show a <unk> and <unk> behaviour.
This is probably increasingly a question of political <unk>
China plays an ever more important role, not only in international trade, but also in the <unk> and cannot afford to be as the main source of the country of origin of counterfeit products that endanger safety, health and even the lives of the citizens of other countries.
However, this development is also justified in the fact that China is becoming increasingly <unk> and cannot be considered solely as a country of origin for which there is a lot of evidence.
At least two speakers have mentioned the 100 % <unk> of the <unk> I can tell you that we really are trying to exert pressure on the US Government and indirectly also to US legislation, as we are absolutely safe, and we are constantly saying that this initiative would give a false sense of security and would draw the wrong attention and resources from the real problems.
We hope to have succeeded.
With your support, with the support of Parliament and with the support of bodies such as the <unk> and <unk> of which the Customs Union is giving great support, I believe that a successful activity of the Customs Union will be guaranteed in the next year of its existence.
Thank you for your contributions and your support.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 June 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
, in writing. - There are many reasons for recognising the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union.
The far-reaching abolition of the <unk> between the Member States of the European Union is one of the most important achievements of the Union and represents a major asset for both companies and consumers in Europe.
A major responsibility has been given to the <unk> at the external borders of the European Union.
<unk> illegal trafficking in drugs and other hazardous substances and the smuggling of endangered species and products pose challenges for the internal market, which must be met with less internal border controls.
Europe has one of the largest markets for falsified products.
The existence and trade of these products constitutes a serious violation of intellectual property rights.
To put an end to this development, further rigorous measures must be taken and implemented.
If we want to face up to this challenge, we need a more harmonised and more determined cooperation between the customs authorities of the various Member States.
Overall, however, the creation of the European single market is a success and deserves to be recognised as a crucial factor that contributes to the prosperity of the entire European Union.
European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (debate)
The next item is the report by Marie <unk> on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion <unk> - <unk> -.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs <unk> and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs <unk> for their excellent work.
The 2010 European Year will play a crucial role in the development of a social Europe.
The chosen approach, which is a year in which central and decentralised methods are combined with each other, should be focused particularly on ensuring political cohesion between citizens and the various levels of decision-making and a degree of flexibility in the specific situation in the individual Member States.
With the 2010 European year, the European Union and its Member States have the opportunity to reaffirm their political commitment and it is clear that poverty and social exclusion are reflected in the social and economic development of the Union and that the dignity of our citizens is violated.
The 2010 European Year should show that poverty can be combated successfully.
In addition, the 2010 European Year will provide a platform for debate on European values and their respect for the development of public policy at Community and Member State level.
It will help to see the people affected by poverty and social exclusion in a different light.
The Commission has always advocated that this approach and this approach should be maintained in the text.
I think most of the European Parliament's amendments are along these lines.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
According to the joint report on social protection and social inclusion for 2008, 16% of the total population is still below the poverty line and 19% of children are threatened by poverty and social exclusion, despite all the commitments made by the Member States from 2000 to poverty by 2010.
Poverty affects not only women, children and certain particularly vulnerable social groups.
It is still a long way from the world and is currently being exacerbated by international developments in the energy and food sector, as well as internal inequalities in less prosperous regions.
These outermost regions, islands and other regions are struggling with chronic structural disadvantages.
Poverty and social exclusion pose a threat to development, competitiveness and the social model and are a violation of human rights in a Europe that is a good example of respect for human dignity and the promotion of equal opportunities for all.
With the Commission's proposal for a European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which has increased funding compared to previous European years, an important contribution is made to promoting solidarity, social justice and better economic and social cohesion.
Our aim is to significantly increase awareness of poverty and social exclusion by 2010.
This is not just about material poverty, but also about access to health care, housing, social protection, education, training, employment and quality of life.
We must realise that people living in poverty have a right to live in dignity and to participate in social and economic life.
We must reaffirm that the European agencies and the social partners and all citizens are responsible for improving social cohesion.
In 2010, the cornerstone of effective structures of joint responsibility and a fair redistribution of prosperity will be laid down.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been in the forefront of the proposals and has adopted amendments to enable all the groups in the European Parliament to cooperate.
We have improved the Commission's proposal by extending the definition of vulnerable groups of people, aspects such as the needs of families with specific problems, <unk> parents and <unk> and the special problems of people with disabilities and homeless and promoting active involvement and access to culture and leisure activities.
This does not, of course, detract from our main objective of improving the financial situation of individuals and families through access to adequate and permanent employment.
With good employment it is a pleasure to participate and the necessary <unk> to meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of our society, such as children and old people.
As Members of the European Parliament, we have closely monitored the proper implementation of Community legislation on equal opportunities.
We were involved in drawing up and implementing coordinated policy strategies at national, regional and local level, which were developed by public and private institutions in order to meet the principles of good governance, subsidiarity and proportionality.
One of the factors necessary for the success of the year to combat poverty is to strengthen the open method of coordination, the coordination of measures of existing Community programmes and the results of the previous European years and the correct evaluation of the proposals and results of the European Commission.
The question of whether NGOs are involved and how many resources are to be allocated to their actions was discussed in the Conciliation Committee of the Council and Parliament.
We are pleased that the Council has agreed to an annex to adding an annex with an additional opinion from the Commission, which advocates the participation of small and medium-sized NGOs and the possibility of full funding of their actions by national agencies.
I would like to thank the competent staff, colleagues and Members for their support in drawing up the decision.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (PL) Mr President, improving the quality of life of the citizens of the Union is a fundamental objective of European integration.
Nevertheless, the statistics show that in the Union 78 million people are currently living below the poverty line, most of them children, women and <unk>
This means that the European Union must also take social initiatives in addition to its economic measures, and this has been pointed out repeatedly by the European Parliament.
In its resolution of 15 November 2007, Parliament stressed that the strengthening of social cohesion and the eradication of poverty and social exclusion must be a political priority for the European Union.
The Commission's initiative in 2010 to combat poverty and social exclusion is <unk> in this context and can contribute significantly to bringing political attention to political attention and mobilising all the stakeholders in order to promote social protection and social inclusion.
The budget for this <unk> budget - EUR 17 million - is as high as never before, but it is essential to implement the projects at national level so that this initiative is a success.
It is therefore important to call on the Member States to participate actively in this initiative and to provide appropriate human and financial resources for this purpose.
Amendment of the <unk> see Minutes
European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (continuation of debate)
We continue the debate on the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and now comes to the speeches on behalf of the groups.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
They seem to have been <unk> <unk> and <unk>
78 million in the EU, including 19 million <unk> a <unk>
A clear <unk>
Young people who do not create school and who are <unk> are just like <unk> who have small pensions in spite of the work they have done in the <unk>
They feel <unk> <unk> and have often left themselves alone.
The result is a daily life, mental as physically as physically extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alcohol and drugs - a life in which dignity and <unk> are not found.
The annual reports in our Member States are <unk>
Last year, I followed the <unk> of the German <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It led to controversial controversial public debates.
That is what the stakeholders need to do so that they take care of the fact that they are taken seriously out of poverty.
Mrs Maria <unk> very good report - and I should like to say this on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - is the green light for 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
If there are not only analyses of the situation but also of the need to listen to the vulnerable target groups, when institutions present concrete achievements rather than just fine intentions when <unk> <unk> <unk> which has led to <unk> and if social <unk> which have reduced the risk of poverty, then many who are still marginalised today should feel that they have a right to participate in our society.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (CS) First of all, I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs <unk> for her excellent report and the pleasant cooperation.
I will deal with two aspects.
In many of our documents, the concepts of <unk> work' and <unk> are <unk>
The fact is, however, that more and more jobs are about <unk> activities, in other words about poorly paid <unk>
The number of people living in poverty or poverty is not going back, which is proof that more and more employers are employing people illegally.
The adoption of the draft Working Time Directive is a further step backwards because it allows workers to employ workers under conditions like in some Chinese <unk> which will undoubtedly increase the number of poor people.
In addition, I believe that we must finally recognise the fact that the privatisation of public and social services in some countries of the Union is lagging behind.
This privatisation will also lead to an increase in the number of people living in poverty.
Unfortunately, my amendments which refer to this issue are regularly rejected.
I would like us finally to do something instead of describing more and more paper and set deadlines.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to emphasise that I think it is very good that 2010 is a particular priority for the policy against poverty and social exclusion throughout Europe.
However, let me make a few critical comments.
The way in which improvements have been made to the proposals for improvements - particularly under pressure from the Council - only in the first reading of an agreement has been severely <unk>
I have asked for more funding in the 2010 budget for this important initiative, but the fight against poverty is a clear objective of the Lisbon Agenda, which unfortunately has not been achieved at all.
I also wanted to see the many <unk> which the EU Commission <unk> particularly with regard to 2010, will be more closely looked at if these are a fairer balance or if they may even help the rich to become richer with the poor.
I would also have liked to see a discussion on the introduction of an unconditional <unk> within the EU institutions, especially from the <unk> whether this would be an appropriate instrument for combating poverty and against social exclusion.
I very much regret that these proposals have been <unk>
I am in favour of the initiative of a European year, but I am all too non-binding and have too few social consequences.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, 2010 is a very good initiative from the Council to combat poverty and social exclusion.
We must remind our citizens that the fight against poverty is one of the European Union's main objectives.
This undoubtedly strengthens people's confidence in our European institutions, and I am thinking in particular of the new Member States.
In my country, Poland, many citizens are still joining the Union in 2004 with an increase in poverty, especially for people in the country and in <unk>
This was reflected in the low turnout and in the results of the elections to the European Parliament.
The European Year for Combating Poverty is an opportunity to review the situation and encourage Member States to take concrete action in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
If we look at society, it seems that the quality of life of many people and families has changed significantly in recent times both in the old and the new EU and, unfortunately, the <unk>
It is becoming increasingly difficult to find housing.
In this regard, we need new and up-to-date statistics.
In an increasingly globalised and increasingly difficult world, the state should assume greater responsibility for the citizens.
The state should ensure that citizens feel safe, at least on a certain scale.
With this European year, I believe that it will above all be possible to inform people that this problem exists to increase awareness and to strengthen solidarity, also in financial terms, with poor and marginalised people.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament supports the report presented by our colleague and thus also the aim of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
The importance of poverty and social exclusion both as a social problem, but also for the people affected by poverty have been made very clear.
Reference has also been made on several occasions to the 78 million people, which are 19 million children living within the EU in poverty.
However, in order to combat poverty seriously and to eradicate as a social problem, concrete, binding environmental targets are required.
Political objectives and the guarantee of individual rights to life without poverty and social exclusion are on the agenda.
That is precisely what the European Union does not want.
The European Union's most important environmental policies are not linked to the fight against poverty.
Economic growth and economic growth are not <unk>
Even the richest Member States of the European Union see an increase in the number of people living in poverty or even below <unk>
In the last few years, in Germany, the number of <unk> has gone down.
Employment in the EU is therefore not a matter for the prevention of poverty, and these findings within the European Commission and the Member States are not, unfortunately, followed by any concrete <unk> which would also be the aim of the enforcement of <unk> above the <unk> within the European Union, and would also resolve the problem of social security problems raised by Mr <unk>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs <unk>
I believe that we urgently need to address the problem of child poverty.
In the context of statistics on the number of children threatened by poverty - 19 million in Europe - the fundamental importance of the family and therefore the safeguarding of family life is still much more important.
The institution of <unk> deserves full respect and protection.
It is the natural environment of children.
We note that, in developed countries, poverty is becoming increasingly <unk> and as a regional phenomenon.
The economic status of a child is closely linked to that of his parents.
The unemployment of parents is therefore a cause of <unk>
In Ireland <unk> health care and care systems for cars can be the majority of a often fairly acceptable <unk> so that little is left for children.
There are other aspects, such as <unk> of parents so that the money is not sufficient for a safe childhood.
The financial burden of separation and divorce is also damaging to children.
It is imperative that families be supported economically and socially in order to alleviate the shameful reality of child poverty in today's Europe.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I note that the report before us today is specifically aimed at eliminating and not just the fight against poverty.
I am therefore pleased that my objection has been <unk> and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs <unk>
The European Union is used to react quickly and in a very cooperative manner, for example, to help the victims of natural disasters around the world, but it is still looking for many <unk> when it comes to supporting the victims of economic and social disasters within the EU.
I am addressing this point because I find it difficult to understand that in a report dealing with the issue of poverty, no mention has been made of the rise in food prices.
I am shocked because we all know that the poorer a family is a family, the higher the proportion of food to its <unk>
I therefore think it would be useful to include a reference to the current Commission communication on the rise in food prices.
I also believe that, in the meantime, we should not only combat poverty in the EU territory.
This battle knows no borders, because it is about values that constitute an essential element of human dignity.
In the course of its history, Europe has been increasingly marked by its global <unk> as its own identity.
In the 21st century, the EU could contribute in many ways for the good of mankind, but the <unk> is probably the most important task that it can fulfil here.
I therefore hope that this issue will receive great support in 2010.
(SV) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner.
Let me begin by thanking Mrs <unk> for an excellent piece of work.
I would also like to emphasise that I believe that the initiative to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion is excellent.
This year, as Mr Špidla said, we can increase awareness and knowledge of the current structures, but that is not enough.
This must be followed by action, as some of the previous speakers have said.
Generally speaking, the situation in the EU is quite good, but poverty does not diminish but is increasing, and many of those affected are women and children, as others have already pointed out.
The necessary approach is the open method of coordination, but we need measures in a variety of areas, not just in some areas.
Of course, employment is very important, but also education, social security and regional policy, which draws attention to neglected areas.
We need targeted measures for certain groups, such as people with disabilities and people from other parts of the world, which are more affected than others.
I hope that this European Year will not only increase knowledge and awareness but will also be a starting point for concrete measures to combat poverty in the EU.
(PL) Mr President, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will be the culmination of the social agenda.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has adopted a number of common indicators for the process of social protection and the integration of the data.
Although the European Union is aware of the problem of poverty and appreciates the importance of measures to strengthen social cohesion in the countries of the EU, there is still an increase in economic growth.
This does not benefit the poor from this growth.
In the end this leads to a reduction in the level of social cohesion.
There are also other factors which have negative consequences and almost every fifth child in the European Union is threatened by poverty.
In times of age, we should be particularly concerned about children, especially in order to protect children from <unk> families who are most <unk>
However, these families are discriminated against by the high rate of VAT on <unk>
I congratulate the rapporteur in particular for drawing attention to the problem of combating poverty.
(SK) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome Mrs <unk> report and the Commission's determination to continue the fight against poverty.
The widespread spread of poverty is probably one of the most glaring contradictions in the prosperous Europe.
It is no coincidence that all other colleagues have the high figures mentioned by the millions of people who talk about a risk of poverty, but the most important thing is that a very large number of children are born and live with a risk of poverty.
It is therefore not surprising that these children leave school at an early stage that the number of early school leavers is <unk> high.
<unk> is also very <unk> in the hundreds of thousands of children living on the streets or in facilities.
The problem is that poverty and social exclusion are being <unk>
In this way, the opportunities for education and participation in the lifelong learning process for the socially excluded people remain an objective objective.
Let us hope that the Year for Combating Poverty will give sufficient impetus to strengthening the internal market in national policies.
However, when it comes to future changes in the population structure, the implementation of this principle is much more complicated.
The analysis of some of the public health systems and insurance systems shows that in some Member States they are experiencing financial or even social risks and can lead to further spread of poverty.
The current rapid rise in oil and food prices will undoubtedly burden the budgets of the lowest <unk>
There are therefore more than enough reasons for the Year to combat poverty not only for poverty but also for the individual Member States to create special <unk> bodies which can support the coordination of various policies in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
(ES) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the Commission and, of course, the rapporteur, because she has given us the opportunity to hold this debate and to take the first steps to ensure 2010 is an important year in the fight against poverty.
As we discussed in Lisbon, it is one of the objectives of the European Union, and we and many Council meetings have confirmed that in 2010 we have to achieve a significant reduction in poverty, but unfortunately there are no <unk>
We must therefore make additional efforts and use this opportunity to make it clear that increasing prosperity does not benefit us all.
Some sectors of the population are particularly vulnerable and need protection against poverty, because it is only in poverty that it is very difficult to escape it.
That is why we need a horizontal policy that provides decent jobs and <unk> not just as part of this programme, but of all the European Union's programmes, so that solidarity is the core of the Union and is not just the subject of economic policy.
(PT) Mr President, it could be said that the data we have collected reduce the extent of the problem.
They are referring to poverty in the European Union in the run-up to Bulgaria and <unk>
After the accession of these two countries in the world, the <unk> system in the EU has increased significantly.
We must not conceal that.
In addition, not only is it a fact that every seventh citizen of the EU Member States is living below the poverty line, but in fact more than 16% is actually more than 20%.
I would therefore urge that the European Union fund all the projects we have discussed with more than 50%.
This is particularly important from the point of view of the poorer countries.
If we limit the sum to 50%, we will be able to reduce the real fight against poverty.
(Applause)
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question that the inalienable rights of the socially vulnerable groups must be recognised and the practical recognition of these rights will require a strong commitment to public and private interest in society.
It is the task of the EU and its Member States to preserve the multiple dimensions of social cohesion by using concrete measures at all possible levels for employment prevention and the fight against social exclusion.
There is also a need for comprehensive and proper control of poverty and social exclusion, Commissioner, so we urgently need reliable and comparable indicators which show the development of the various social, economic and cultural dimensions of this phenomenon.
Poor women and <unk> are particularly vulnerable to poverty and exclusion and must therefore receive special attention and support.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and point out that 2010 must be a particularly successful year in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and this fight must also be brought to the attention of the public.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to three problems in this debate.
Firstly, according to the recent European Commission report, approximately 100 million EU citizens have had to survive in 2004, with less than 60% of the total income in the EU, which means that they have had less than EUR 15 per day.
In the new Member States such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia, this affects almost 80% of the population.
Secondly, in the economic and social practices of the EU countries, there should be no solutions to the applications that are often put forward by liberal economists according to which clear differences of payments are important for economic growth.
In 2006, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic were the countries with the least <unk> and these countries have been able to draw attention to a stable annual growth in GDP, whereas in the countries with the largest <unk> it is the same as Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and Greece and, unfortunately, my own country, Poland.
Thirdly, I have the hope that, as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2010, as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, poverty and social exclusion will have devastating effects on economic growth and social development.
(Applause)
(RO) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are very well aware of what the Commission has to tell us <unk> a great many Europeans live in poverty, even in extreme poverty.
Those who do not know that should take the blame for the fact that a rich society that is based on principles of justice and solidarity is working on the principles of justice and solidarity, that a country of poor Europeans would have more seats in this Parliament than Germany.
Poverty is not a <unk> it is a <unk> which affects women and children.
In view of the structural <unk> the fact that a large number of women are working in poorly organised areas and in the black economy, as well as in the black economy, as well as in the <unk> are often the only ones who are exposed to increased risks.
Poverty is <unk>
Because of limited access to education, the economic poverty of parents encourages the cultural poverty of children, because of low participation in or by exclusion of <unk> it favours their political poverty and low participation in civic activities and isolation, it favours children's social poverty.
Poverty produces greater differences than those from <unk>
The lack of consistency between rhetoric and action forces us to do more than just raise awareness of the citizens.
Political decisions must be taken to remedy the situation.
We cannot talk about the lack of resources in the Union, but sometimes about their unfair <unk> of legislation that leads to exclusion.
It is a joint responsibility which also includes companies whose responsibility should go beyond a stage in which the financing of a foundation for the protection of stray dogs is the only expression of social obligations.
(PL) Mr President, the proclamation of 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will not solve the problems of the 80 million citizens in the European Union living below the poverty line.
The creation of a committee and more and more bureaucracy, meetings and meetings will not be <unk>
If we want to combat poverty, we must tackle the issue of creating and distributing wealth.
It must be said clearly that globalisation leads to some excessive wealth and leads to a rapid impoverishment for others.
Unfortunately, the latter are becoming more and more common.
The problem of poverty in the Union will continue for a number of reasons, and this includes the unfair <unk> difficulties in the distribution of food and the rising cost of <unk> generally increasing costs for the maintenance of a family, the demographic situation in Europe and the world, the backwardness of certain regions for historical reasons and the inability to produce a proper model helping the people in need.
Finally, since we are not able to solve the problem of poverty as a whole, we should at least allow children and young people free education and the need for additional <unk>
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to highlight one specific aspect and will speak in Polish <unk>
(PL) Mr President, we are trying to help the poor countries in Africa and Latin America, which is hardly effective, but there is no justification for failing to help the poor in the European Union.
There are areas where people are very poor, especially children.
I would like to draw attention to an issue that will have serious consequences in the future, namely the phenomenon of <unk>
These are children from migrants who move from a country in the EU to another and often leave their children their fate.
I believe that in the future we will have to pay dearly for the mental consequences of this problem.
We should therefore make every effort to tackle this problem now.
(RO) Mr President, the eradication of poverty and social exclusion is one of the main objectives of the European Union.
For this reason, 2010 should be crucial in implementing the European strategy in this area.
Of the 78 million of poverty, 19 million children are <unk>
Unfortunately, there are still no European programmes and funds to improve the situation of children.
The European Union has provided financial resources for fruit and milk products in schools or dairy products in schools and <unk> but I believe we need a coherent strategy and specific programmes designed specifically for children from poor families.
At the same time, we should focus our attention on other groups, especially young people, for which we have to develop strategies and provide substantial sums of money from the Structural Funds.
What is more, without the necessary financial resources, we cannot create the conditions for sustainable social development.
I do not believe that the amount allocated to the sum of EUR 17 million is sufficient if we are to look at the requirements currently in force in Europe regarding social inclusion and poverty.
Last but not least, the fight against poverty and social exclusion should be based on the existing programmes.
Both the European Social Fund and the European programmes on PROGRESS should be used to finance the priorities of the European Year for Combating Poverty.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate you on this excellent proposal.
I also thank Mrs <unk> for her very good report.
I am sure we will adopt the resolution unanimously.
But I also ask questions.
We now have another European year, this time against extreme poverty.
For 20 years, the international community has been celebrating the International Day of Combating Poverty on 17 October.
However, when I met on 17 October at the European Parliament meeting in Brussels on 17 October, I myself and my colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo who led the working group of this Parliament to <unk>
I would like to take this opportunity today to ask you to ask for this date in its calendar to be <unk>
I hope that on 17 October, the European institutions will express their strong attachment to the slogan of this day <unk> <unk> always condemned people to live in poverty.
To use united forces to respect them is our sacred <unk>
(SK) In the European Union, 78 million people live with a <unk>
Increasing prices for raw materials, energy and food is also the risk to the most vulnerable groups.
A high level of employment is reducing the cost of employment.
In many cases, however, workers are also under threat.
The new Lisbon Strategy promotes equal opportunities for all the social and economic solidarity and the creation of a society free of poverty.
I therefore support the initiative to make it more visible and to seek a unified coordinated approach.
The campaign to combat poverty should raise public awareness and lead to long-term efforts to combat the phenomenon of poverty.
In this respect, we can learn a lot from the Scandinavian countries that have shown that an active labour market policy is linked to the creation of worthy working conditions and a strong social protection of one of the most effective ways of combating poverty.
(LT) I welcome the Commission's proposal for 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
Poverty is a problem not only in the EU, but also worldwide.
Let me address some of the urgent aspects of poverty and social exclusion, which we should deal with much more closely than before.
Firstly, the elimination of child poverty would be able to break the vicious circle for the generations of people to live in poverty and social exclusion.
Secondly, almost 10% of workers learn from low wages, part-time work and low qualifications themselves.
We therefore urgently need to develop qualified jobs through training for workers.
Thirdly, it is essential to promote solidarity within society and to raise awareness of poverty and social exclusion.
I would like to encourage all the Community institutions and Member States to inform their citizens more specifically about the fight against poverty and social exclusion, so that a sense of shared responsibility can be created and the prejudice of the financial burden on society from the world can be achieved.
(PL) Mr President, poverty is a very complex problem.
It can occur in a variety of forms, and it is different in each country.
The problem in Europe is not about people who die from hunger but the biggest problems in particular are low incomes, <unk> <unk> poor health, often <unk> a feeling of alienation or a lack of prospects.
Poverty is a dangerous phenomenon, especially <unk> because it is often <unk>
Children who live in poverty have a more difficult development and, without outside help, they are doomed to failure and must share the fate of their parents.
It is therefore important to take all possible measures to suspend the cycle of poverty transferred from one generation to another.
Strengthening social inclusion, reducing poverty and combating social exclusion are some of the challenges facing the European Union, particularly with regard to demographic change, which I mean to the ageing of the population and the <unk>
(PT) It is not enough for a European Year to combat poverty when almost 20% of EU citizens are threatened by poverty.
The development that is exacerbated by social inequalities, the growth of poorly paid and insecure jobs, an increase in the number of poor and rising food prices and food prices requires other policies to integrate children, women and families into society.
We must take action to make work more attractive to employment and to promote employment with rights and to guarantee high-quality public services, decent housing and a public and general social security system.
As a substitute for the neoliberal policy of the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact, therefore, a European strategy for solidarity and social progress must be adopted without delay, so that the number of poor people will not increase even further.
(ES) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur and the Commissioner on this initiative.
Social exclusion and poverty are two sides of the same coin and are features of a society with very needy people, a society without social cohesion.
<unk> ladies and gentlemen, progress is a matter of ethics.
2010 is the year to fight poverty.
We know that the elimination of social exclusion and poverty will be a long and complicated task, but if we are to make the best of all the euros invested in this programme, if we are able to bring the groups that are particularly vulnerable if we succeed in raising the consciences of the public, new European citizenship will be created.
That is the big task.
Last week, the citizens of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon.
A demagogic propaganda that has taken up a wide range of opinions has caused devastating damage in Irish society because it led to unfounded fears from globalisation and some confusion about the construction of our common home.
For this reason, 2010 must be the year to fight poverty, but also the year of European citizenship.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his opinion.
Let us hope that the joint guidelines in the strategic framework programme will actually provide the national committees with help in planning effective measures.
The Commission itself has stressed that our main objective must be to take into account all the people affected by poverty.
Personally, I think that poverty cannot be eliminated once and for all.
We have talked about the <unk> or <unk> in Greece and other countries; this means that there can be poverty once again or through international developments.
We must therefore always be <unk>
That is why we attach particular importance to prevention, which is why the day to combat poverty on 17 October, to which Mrs Záborská referred.
This date is mentioned in our report.
It is therefore not a question of more or less binding measures, we want them to meet all national needs and believe that the fight against poverty is a fight against the greatest enemy of peace and prosperity in every community.
The Commissioner is without doubt historical and knows that the emperor of <unk> a poor in Europe, who was able to <unk> 1 000 years in the fight against poverty, has been using the emperor in Europe.
After the numerous <unk> he <unk> on the borders of his <unk> he described poverty as the biggest <unk>
We in the EU too must fight poverty within and outside our borders.
We must implement the much cited Millennium Goals so that we can also address the problem of economic migrants and illegal immigrants who come to us because they compare their own situation.
If we are well planning we will certainly succeed in this way and I would like to thank you all for your outstanding contributions.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
, in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs <unk> on her excellent report, especially on the issue of preventing poverty.
I welcome the fact that 2010 is being declared the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
In the debate on the report, I would like to point out how important it is to find concrete measures to deal with poverty and not just talk about it.
In Europe, 78 million people live in poverty, 19 million children.
We must not forget the importance of the family, which deserves protection and social and economic support, to eliminate the huge poverty of poverty in Europe.
At this point, the cause of poverty should perhaps be mentioned.
Poverty is caused by the significant increase in food and energy prices, which affects particularly vulnerable families and elderly people.
According to the Commission, around 14% of the permanently employed Poland, Greeks and Portuguese are living in poverty.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the spirit of cooperation in drafting this report.
In Europe, every sixth below the poverty line is not covered by the statistics on Romania and Bulgaria.
Although in most Member States the difference between men and women is gradually reduced in terms of poverty and lasting <unk> on average, I would like to draw your attention to the reality of the new Member States.
In Romania and Bulgaria, 10 % more women are threatened than men of poverty.
Women are also exposed to much more social exclusion.
We should not forget that solidarity, social justice and eradication are challenges that affect not only countries in the European Union, but also their commitment at global economic and political level.
I would therefore welcome the fact that the gender aspect would be taken into account in a separate article in the final text.
I also consider it important that the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and the Millennium Development Goals and in particular the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty should be in touch with this.
in writing. - (HU) Poverty is a <unk> <unk> and <unk> problem, which raises economic, social and cultural issues.
Nevertheless, measures to combat poverty are needed in 2006 and not less than 16% of the total population of the 25 Member States of the European Union below the poverty line.
When the Lisbon Strategy was launched in March 2000, the Council of the European Union called on the Member States and the Commission to take measures to make the eradication of poverty crucial by 2010.
It is an important step that we now have a level of poverty, because first of all the exact scope must be determined before tackling the problem.
I welcome the decision to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
I am sure that this year will promote the exchange of best practice and bring new initiatives to every area, particularly in connection with the prevention of poverty, the monitoring of <unk> and the fight against <unk>
It is also particularly important to emphasise that women are more exposed to poverty than men, and this is particularly true in many disadvantaged women.
It is essential that the principle of equality should also be taken into account in the fight against poverty and therefore in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
Genuine equality of the sexes is a crucial prerequisite for reducing the retirement age, as women who are subject to an appropriate and proportionate activity with their family duties are less threatened by poverty.
The constitution of the International Labour Organisation is <unk> <unk> wherever there is a threat to prosperity.
I would therefore like to stress the importance of the amendment to prevent and combat poverty through cross-sectoral policies at local, regional and local level, which would guarantee the active participation of citizens in public life and the labour market.
Social protection reforms and measures for active inclusion have played a decisive role in speeding up economic growth and creating more jobs in Europe.
In the first quarter of 2008 economic growth in Romania was a rate of <unk> one of the largest in the EU, according to Eurostat, according to which the European average is <unk> but people with low school education, in particular from rural areas, children, young people, people with disabilities and the Roma were exposed to considerable poverty.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work and I believe that the strategies drawn up as a result of European recommendations must aim to reconcile economic competitiveness and the social well-being of the citizens to their benefit.
Cohesion policy (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by <unk> <unk> on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the impact of cohesion policy on the integration of vulnerable communities and groups.
rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, there are regions in these regions and people living in these regions live in the regions that are unable to take advantage of the opportunities that we offer to them to enable them to achieve the European Union's energy potential as quickly as possible and to overcome the poverty in which they live.
With this report, I wanted to show why we have not managed to develop these regions and make recommendations on how this situation can change and overcome.
The Fourth European Commission report on cohesion shows that cohesion policy is quite successful at national level in some countries.
In concrete terms, this means that in those countries that have joined the European Union and receive funds from the Cohesion Fund, there are more dynamic developments and real progress towards cohesion.
However, in view of the territorial levels involved, it is clear that the differences between the different regions are not being <unk>
Let me give you an example: in that country the GDP per capita in the central region has reached 110 % of the European Union's gross domestic product, whereas in four of the seven regions of Hungary below 45% of the <unk>
In these regions, the differences do not go further.
However, the fourth report on cohesion also shows that territorial differences within the regions often continue to increase.
What could be the causes of some regions being able to benefit from the opportunities available to them, while others are unable to do so?
In closer inspection, it is clear that this development has very serious structural causes, that is to say, structural causes at territorial level.
In <unk> which only have weak development, there is clearly no shortage of resources for the creation of appropriate projects, the infrastructure needed for investment in these territories is not available and lacks adequate education and training for the citizens.
In Hungary, for example, there are several <unk> in which the life expectancy of men lies by more than 15 years of age.
What can we do about this?
Given that we are dealing with a problem of extremely complex nature which obviously focuses on certain <unk> and <unk> I think we need to consider whether it is right that cohesion policy should be analysed only at inter-regional level, in other words at the level of regions.
Would it not be more appropriate to consider whether more <unk> and targeted measures are needed at the level of <unk> where the problems are most <unk>
As a first step, we should look at the statistics that we use as a starting point for the decision-making process.
I have been aware of this problem in drawing up the report, but I cannot provide you with a specific basis for a statistical comparison because there is a lack of comparable statistical data in the whole of the EU.
We have to look at whether it is right to involve rural cohesion in agricultural policy, even though it is mostly rural areas.
Would it not be much better to deal with the problems of rural areas within the framework of cohesion policy and to use the instruments of the cohesion policy so that the policies of agricultural policy can only have a <unk> <unk>
At this point, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their very constructive commitment to drafting this report.
At the same time, I would like to point out that the PPE-DE Group has decided to vote in favour of the report itself, with a very important amendment on an important point of the report by the PPE-DE Group.
For me, what do we want to do?
Do we simply have to say that there is a problem, or do we want to ask ourselves the problem and make recommendations to change our policy and focus more on determining areas where we really can do something to resolve the problem?
Thank you for your attention.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr <unk> for his report and for his efforts to reach a consensual position of his committee on the difficult issue of vulnerable communities and groups.
In order to prevent economic growth parallel with social polarisation within our society, cohesion policy is directed against social exclusion and, in particular, the integration of vulnerable communities and groups that will remain an important objective of cohesion policy in the future.
Moreover, it is a fact that the problems identified in the report at the interface between cohesion and social cohesion on the one hand and social cohesion are on the other hand, and so problems of social polarisation and social exclusion when they are concentrated in certain areas are problems of territorial cohesion.
We face social exclusion in the poorest areas of the European Union, but we find it also in the form of islands in the richest cities of the EU.
The report calls on the Commission to present a comprehensive definition of territorial cohesion within the framework of the forthcoming Green Paper on territorial cohesion, and I can assure you that the forthcoming Green Paper will contribute to progress in the EU's common understanding of the concept of territorial cohesion.
The report also recognises that the concept of vulnerable groups and communities as such is certainly not a simple one, and should not be confined to Roma communities.
On the other hand, it is widely acknowledged that the situation of Roma communities in Europe deserves special attention.
In order to counter the complex problems of Roma exclusion, we need an integrated approach, and Parliament has discussed this in detail in connection with its resolution on a European Roma strategy in January.
In the package of the renewed social agenda, the Commission will present its working paper on Community instruments and measures to integrate the Roma in early July.
I share the view expressed in the report that we need to make better use of the synergies and <unk> of European measures and the various financing instruments available.
The Commission has given great attention to the operational programmes of cohesion policy with national and regional authorities.
I share the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in terms of data protection for all the regions of the European Union as well, with particular reference to social indicators, although it seems essential to us to do so.
As Members are aware, Eurostat does not raise data but manages the information provided by national statistical systems.
We have just completed the second framework programme for the period up to 2004, and we see how few territorial data is below the traditional regional NUTS NUTS <unk>
In order to resolve this difficult task and also to use the context of the cohesion strategy for territorial cohesion, the Directorate-General for Regional Policy has developed measures to improve the quality of research into regional policy, including the statistical bases.
As a result, the 2000-2006 expenditure will be reduced to NUTS 3 <unk> at NUTS III level at this level, for <unk> <unk> the <unk> and Interreg programmes and the Cohesion Fund.
The implementation of audits for rural areas is a task that still lies ahead of us, and I must admit that we still do not have reliable data on where vulnerable groups are going to grow.
That is why it is impossible to make our new information, where and what resources of cohesion policy are used with the local concentration of these groups, which is how the problem is today, I believe that we still have room for progress in this area, especially in the case of specific research through qualitative <unk>
I would like to thank Parliament once again for raising these important points and looking forward to today's debate.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (PT) As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like once again to emphasise the need to support rural areas and mountain regions where women play a central role.
We must pay tribute to their work and to guarantee them an adequate income.
We need high-quality public services and high-quality public services to keep young people and to prevent rural areas.
In the current reform of the common agricultural policy, family businesses and small and medium-sized farms must pay special attention to the fact that this policy is becoming fairer and that rural areas can be promoted and that agricultural products can be promoted.
I would also like to stress that it is necessary to support the disadvantaged regions, which are structurally disadvantaged areas, the outermost regions and areas affected by industrial restructuring, migration or closures in order to strengthen economic and social cohesion and the social integration of vulnerable communities and groups.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and for the efforts he has made to reconcile various points of view.
We all believe that vulnerable groups and communities are struggling in their development with many difficulties and that they need special attention in the context of cohesion policy and the other financial resources available to them.
During all the <unk> I have supported the need for the report to be divided into two separate parts. Part of the ethnic belonging to vulnerable communities, and the second part relates to vulnerable communities characterised by certain geographical disadvantages.
Unfortunately, our request is not reflected in the present form of the report.
Our group has tabled three amendments which depend on the adoption of our vote, namely the deletion of recital <unk> which is identical to the content of recital I, the declaration of a sensitive area or a sensitive zone by its list and the deletion of paragraph 17. We hope the rapporteur will agree with us in this respect.
Finally, I would like to highlight two further ideas to highlight the problems faced by vulnerable communities, regardless of what the ethnic and/or <unk> approach could be treated more efficiently if there were cooperation between local, regional, national and European authorities.
At the same time, the role of the education system and the public, social and transport infrastructure for the integration of vulnerable groups and communities is essential.
Finally, I would like to say that, as I have already mentioned, our final position depends on the adoption of the three amendments, in particular the deletion of paragraph 17, which was voted on in the Commission.
If these amendments are adopted, we will of course support the report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work on the report presented to us today.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that there is an urgent need to find a more proactive approach aimed at <unk> disparities and particularly vulnerable areas.
<unk> disparities are even more important in certain cases than differences between regions.
Let us not forget that the objective and the <unk> of European regional policy is to reduce disparities in development between individual regions, and the phenomenon of territorial exclusion has not yet been included in the political instruments.
In the new Member States, social segregation and lack of equal opportunities are the most frequent in rural areas, but economic and social initiatives in the regions focus on dynamic centres, primarily urban <unk>
The resources to combat poverty and social exclusion vary from country to country, but in order to create a European Union of territorial and social cohesion, we need to take additional measures which will be the potential of the economically underdeveloped regions.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (RO) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
Cohesion policy is vital for the communities in the underdeveloped regions and regions.
Economic and social aspects, such as poverty, lack of infrastructure and <unk> low education and <unk> low education, poor living conditions and limited access to services of general interest make these communities become vulnerable groups and represent an ever greater challenge for the territorial cohesion of the European Union.
There is a mutual relationship between the need to reduce the socio-economic differences between regions and the need to integrate vulnerable groups into society, a relationship that should, of course, lead to a constructive process that will lead to a <unk> approach both at national and European level.
Mr President, I believe that the lack of statistical information on the distribution of these groups and of the degree of social exclusion and the fact that indicators for measuring the disparities between regions cannot provide reliable data once more, once more, that the Member States and the Commission need to work more closely so that they can become a <unk> picture of the situation of vulnerable regions and groups and develop concrete programmes and strategies for territorial development and overcoming social exclusion.
I also believe that the first step in the Member States should be to identify these vulnerable groups and define their priority in the national strategic plans and to develop mechanisms for evaluating and monitoring them.
We should not forget that migration is usually a consequence of poverty and that the phenomenon of migration itself causes instability and conflict.
For this reason, Mr President, we believe that vulnerable groups should benefit from social assistance from all Member States, from equal opportunities and, more importantly, from special programmes to develop their <unk>
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr <unk> for dealing with this difficult issue, although the report does not cover all aspects relating to situations, persons or <unk> which are excluded or threatened.
Although a substantial proportion of the European Union's budget is intended to implement its cohesion policy, there are still serious inequalities.
Just look at GDP per <unk> in the richest regions, it is almost ten times higher than in the poorest regions.
We must not forget that there are significant differences within the regions.
In large cities, there are also <unk> <unk>
This is also a major problem in many rural areas.
This poverty is becoming part of a generation for the next <unk>
Let us therefore protect children and families from this phenomenon.
First and foremost, equal opportunities must be created, especially in the fields of education, health care and health care.
This brings us to evidence of social and territorial cohesion, which we have not yet defined correctly.
The prospects for the future of people living in <unk> cultural and cultural areas are significantly worse.
This concerns both technical and social infrastructure, as well as jobs and the creation of a climate of internal activity in these societies.
Let us help our <unk> who are discriminated against in one way or another, so that they can regain their chance to escape the low social position.
We must also break with the stereotypes that these groups <unk>
This concerns a large number of disabled people or disabled people, including the Roma societies.
This kind of segregation runs counter to our common solidarity and is a sign of lack of respect for human dignity.
Let us remember how often we are dealing with <unk> families or <unk>
We also need a common policy to ensure equality at various levels at a regional, national and EU level.
We also need <unk> and we need non-governmental organisations.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I thank Mr <unk> for his attention to the vulnerable groups.
Cohesion policy has long been a major contribution to improving the situation of vulnerable groups.
Let us take Ireland, for example, a country with very vulnerable <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In many other countries too, there must be social exclusion, employment, education and participation.
That is the path we are taking and which is also very successful.
A second <unk> as I have said, is that we know too little, too little information.
I agree that this could be improved in particular by the Member States, regions and towns themselves.
Mr <unk> is amazed to see why the life expectancy of Hungarians is 15% below average life expectancy in the EU.
I do not know the reason for this, but I have visited hospitals.
The <unk> and <unk> are extremely <unk> and the European Community cannot do anything.
I believe that people in the regions belong to the essential foundations of our policy.
Finally, what is the real reason why the PPE-DE Group <unk>
We are opposed because we decided in 2004 to strengthen the policy by 2013, for more substance, a stronger focus.
We have even decided to include the entire external border as such in the policy for external border control.
This leads to <unk> <unk> in our efforts and we should not go along with this in the future in this area.
That would be a mistake.
I would therefore ask you once again to delete the article in question.
I would also like to take a note of the challenge expressed by the rapporteur in discussing territorial cohesion in the next six months.
(ES) Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for taking the initiative to draft a report stating that one of the main objectives of the European Union is to reduce social, economic and regional inequalities.
Cohesion policy has made an effective contribution to reducing these inequalities, but much remains to be done, as stated in the fourth cohesion report.
In all regions, even in the <unk> there are vulnerable groups of people who run the risk of social exclusion and total poverty.
An integrated approach is needed when it comes to a lack of equal opportunities.
Member States and regional administrations need strategies to revive the vulnerable areas, to develop their infrastructure and to promote genuine development opportunities in line with their specific <unk> and to maintain services of general interest through the decentralisation of the public sector through the decentralisation of the public sector.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr <unk> is an extremely important step by the European Parliament to address the vulnerable communities and groups and to gradually integrate them within the framework of a European cohesion policy.
As an initiative that receives my full support, and I congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts, but I would like to contradict the approach to the issue.
Some aspects of the report are still lacking in substance.
Some of these aspects are about vulnerable communities and groups representing a wide range of society and <unk> and not just the Roma.
The European Parliament has already referred to this category in a specific report, which should have included the social and geographical aspects.
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has stressed that such a broader approach is useful but it has not been followed up by its Council.
The report remains one-sided and often involves short-sighted handling of the issue.
I am thinking particularly of the island and island regions, whose <unk> cannot be called into question.
You have no mention of the report.
I am amazed that there are constant definitions or specific references to situations and situations.
I would also like to stress that there are vulnerable communities and groups not only at regional level, but also at regional level.
They need material and technical support, <unk> and scientific know-how, education, training and an administrative basis.
Particular attention should be paid to decentralisation of the public sector and the development of transport networks.
In this case, too, and in these groups, volunteering can play an important role and contribute to activation and integration.
The rapporteur's efforts are beyond question, but I consider the main thrust of the report to be unsatisfactory.
He is <unk> with <unk> and his paragraphs do not make a clear order.
If we really want to help solve the problems of vulnerable groups, we need to draw up clear and clear texts that provide an overview of the issue.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr <unk> on his own-initiative report.
In the context of the Millennium Round, special attention is paid to vulnerable groups that we have not forgotten that the focus of this policy is on the EU's contribution to the well-being of our citizens.
The regional dimension of this matter is clear.
However, it is necessary to analyse the <unk> of small territorial units in order to determine the specific needs and place of vulnerable groups.
Although we have seen that the <unk> is a problem at lower levels - for example in the poorest regions - it affects the whole area and affects all the social groups living in it.
Therefore, policy, strategy and measures must be comprehensive and based on the problems of vulnerable groups and based on a common approach by the European, national and local institutions.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate <unk> <unk> on the excellent work he has done and on his thoughts on this complex and sensitive issue.
I wanted to take an active part in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, because the most vulnerable people are often concentrated in the least developed rural areas and regions with permanent natural handicaps which means that agricultural policy and rural development policy have an important role to play.
I believe that cohesion policy must be aimed at maintaining <unk> agricultural and rural activities in rural areas in order to maintain a population which often falls into the temptation of rural depopulation but also to welcome new inhabitants.
Family firms must be encouraged because they create jobs and have equal access to public services and the provision of public services to meet the needs of disadvantaged families, communities and social groups.
In short, we must make the rural environment attractive and <unk>
We can achieve this objective by linking the various policies carried out in these regions and for those disadvantaged groups and making use of the complementarity of the various financial instruments available.
(SK) I would like to thank <unk> <unk> for the excellent report he has produced and which is not yet clear about the issues that are not yet clear, but which are a more pressing source of problems.
In particular, I would like to mention two specific areas contained in the report: the development of the vulnerable communities, including people from rural areas and the cities of the cities, and the development of the <unk> <unk> which varies depending on the specific circumstances of each country, and which is barely covered by the current statistics.
These two areas are not defined precisely and therefore neglected.
We must state clearly what economic and social communities we in the European Union have in the European Union, we need to analyse what types of underdeveloped fishing facilities there are in the EU and where they are <unk> and we must find solutions to these problems.
Both are difficult to see in the context of the comprehensive successes of cohesion policy.
We must not allow cohesion policy to be a <unk> cheese that is very <unk>
(SK) The report presented correctly refers to the link between social issues and regional development, and Europe must show solidarity and implement cohesion policy.
I myself use a large part of my time for questions that have to do with support for <unk> regions, particularly in Slovakia.
Maintaining a strong and attractive rural area in Europe is essential both for economic and cultural reasons.
I support the call for the Commission to increase the resources provided for in the draft Green Paper on territorial cohesion to resolve regional problems.
This must ensure active participation of the regions and cooperate closely with non-governmental organisations.
In this context, I would particularly like to highlight the social activities of churches and religious communities.
I know from my own experience that their work in favour of poor social groups and regions is extremely effective and often <unk>
We should therefore consider them as an integral part of the European effort to help the vulnerable groups and give them appropriate support at European level.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to point out that this report expresses our conviction that, twenty years after its formulation of the cohesion policy, the solidarity of the Union is to be demonstrated not only to the most disadvantaged European regions and countries, but also to the most vulnerable communities and groups of our population.
We need to strengthen cohesion policy not only financially but also with appropriate mechanisms and procedures that will enable and combat <unk> complex social and economic disparities at local level.
Given the difficulties facing our regions, we must not close our eyes to the problems of poverty and social and territorial exclusion.
coordinated measures must be coordinated at all levels, an integrated approach and coordinated means and strategies to address these problems.
(PL) Mr President, at the moment the focus on capital is concentrated on capital cities and urban <unk>
Developments in the rest of the regions, including rural areas, are being significantly <unk> and these regions are more vulnerable to problems.
Cohesion policy should be aimed at helping these regions and supporting territorial cohesion.
That is why it is essential to improve infrastructure and to increase the attractiveness of these regions for investors, to maintain public services and to improve living conditions and living conditions.
The development of the transport infrastructure is very important to the development of the transport infrastructure, in other words transport infrastructure and transport infrastructure, because this creates the necessary conditions for the <unk> and the creation of new jobs, which gives people the opportunity to continue to stay in the regions and to live in them.
The focus of the common agricultural policy has so far focused mainly on the quality of food, food security and competition, with rural development outside agriculture.
Cohesion policy, rural development policy and employment policy must therefore be better coordinated.
(PL) Mr President, recital N of the report rightly stresses that poverty and exclusion have a very territorial character.
Bearing in mind that the European Union and the content of recital N are generally <unk> and <unk> I call for the funds of the European funds to be used to promote integration of economically disadvantaged areas.
Unfortunately, in my country this year has been violated against this principle.
The funds for improving infrastructure and other aid funds are mostly in <unk> and already developed areas.
This is often because the people who are applying these funds are better prepared.
I hope that this document will help to eliminate these irregularities throughout the European Union.
Member of the Commission.
I believe that this has been a good discussion, and I would like to thank all those who have participated in the debate and have shown that a <unk> political approach is the best way to tackle the problem of different vulnerable communities and groups.
The link between cohesion policy and rural development policy seems particularly important.
I also share the view of the honourable Members that in cases of territorial accumulation of the problems associated with vulnerable groups, there is a <unk> <unk>
Social inclusion should not be separated from <unk> cohesion.
I would also like to thank Members for their emphasis on the <unk> differences.
As many Members have pointed out, the development of <unk> reliable statistics in this context would be a great help.
As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission wants to continue to invest in the development of a relevant database.
We are currently preparing an audit for rural regions, similar to those already carried out.
Good cooperation with the Member States plays a crucial role in this regard, and I am confident that this will be a strong support for Parliament's support.
rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Hübner, not only for her contribution to this report and for the debate but also for her constant efforts to develop and more efficient development of this policy.
I very much appreciate her work and thank her for her openness in relation to my report.
I would now like to comment on some of the questions raised.
If we want to tackle the problem seriously, I think we should do what we also did when we realised the need for the Lisbon process and the importance of implementing this process in cohesion policy, and then adopting a system of allocating the Cohesion Fund to support the Lisbon process.
In the same way, we can take measures to combat the territorial concentration of poverty if we are to do so.
If we decide to do so.
I would also like to say to the PPE-DE Group and, in particular, to Mr van Nistelrooij in particular, that the deletion of paragraph 17 would mean that we accept that there are <unk> which are not able to use the opportunities that they need.
We know that it is <unk> but why do we want to delete the paragraph from the report in which we ask the Commission to examine whether it is not more sensible to grant the regions concerned at <unk> level?
I still do not understand why we should do that.
Mrs <unk> I would like to say that I consider the document presented as a report on regional policy and therefore not as a proper place for discussing issues of ethnic groups.
I do not understand why we should address the problem of ethnic groups at all.
If we look at the matter in Romania from the ethnic point of view, what groups do I believe to be included in the report?
Roma people living in extreme poverty in certain areas?
The <unk> who are also living in a specific area in a particular area of <unk>
Or the <unk> <unk>
On this basis we cannot make decisions on this basis, we need complex indicators, a complex approach and integrated implementation.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I would like to welcome this report by Mr <unk> on the impact of cohesion policy on the integration of vulnerable communities and groups.
The demands will always be to do something about the uncertain future prospects of <unk> or <unk> whose inhabitants are not involved in decision-making and economic development.
I know from my own constituency the difficulties faced not only by disadvantaged producers but also by peripheral regions in the Irish regions.
These rural areas are often unable to secure business or investment.
Politicians should focus above all on combating the rural depopulation mentioned in the report.
Mr <unk> rightly points to the importance of small and medium-sized farms for the preservation of rural communities.
<unk> communities should not be <unk> in cohesion policy, and in the fight against social exclusion, we need a stronger link between rural and regional development.
<unk> communications and transport networks is a practical problem that we must address.
in writing. - (PL) The cohesion policy, which uses around 33% of the EU budget, is of the utmost importance for all EU countries.
Poland is happy to participate in all measures aimed at full economic integration of European society and a reduction in disparities at the level of <unk>
I believe that measures within the framework of cohesion policy are the basic principles to promote sustainable development and to eliminate unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which represent serious social and economic problems in Europe.
Cooperation between all European countries and exchanges of experience is particularly important.
The problems of sustainable development in the EU, which include low incomes, weak infrastructure and low social mobility, are mainly emerging in rural areas.
The situation is exacerbated by the increasing migration of people from rural areas and increased social exclusion in these regions.
Moreover, external factors such as the growing development disparities between the European Union and the United States are also among the problems facing European cohesion policy at the beginning of the 21st century.
In the years <unk> the <unk> in Europe was clearly below that in the United States or Japan.
This has an impact on the declining competitiveness of the European market.
I would like to thank Mr <unk> for clarifying these problems.
in writing. - (HU) In the interests of promoting employment, growth and competitiveness, the European Union must make use of the business and financial system at its disposal as well as possible.
Since the majority of the Roma living in Europe are affected by <unk> and/or absolute unemployment or in the grey economy, the integration of the Roma could have a significant impact on the outcome of the Lisbon Agenda and cohesion policy.
The report states that cohesion policy has helped the poorest regions to reduce delays in economic and social development.
However, further efforts are needed both in quantitative and qualitative terms.
The European Commission and the Member States must work towards coordinating the financial resources available to each other, and until that happens, and until that happens, it must be supported by the financial instruments of the European Union - which are primarily the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund - which are supported by the provision of <unk> for businesses to invest in the development of infrastructure.
In order for these programmes to be used as a success and the means for the intended purpose, we must recognise and eliminate both general and specific obstacles.
In its development of regions which have complex problems with complex problems, they cannot have the <unk> but they are necessary to enable them to receive Community support to which they are entitled.
As far as the Roma people are concerned, those who are born out of a low level of education and unemployment have now become <unk>
Policy Coherence for Development and the effects of the exploitation of certain biological raw materials by the EU on developments in West Africa (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on Policy Coherence for Development and the impact of exploitation of certain biological resources by the EU on development in <unk>
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let me first translate the title.
When we talk about some natural biological resources, we talk about wood and fish.
Wood and fish are the main factors for social and economic development in the region of <unk>
We also talk about the <unk> of forests.
We all know how dramatic this development is.
In West Africa there is still some 13%.
In other words, 87% of forests are already <unk>
We all know what impact this has on the <unk>
We have equally dramatic figures about how overfishing in this area of the Atlantic is <unk> and what major problems this entails.
We all know of course the pictures of <unk> <unk> with migrants from <unk> who are in the Canary Islands.
The link with this development and increased migration from West Africa to the European Union is obvious and <unk> and it is also being discussed politically in our societies.
The European Union is the <unk> of timber and fish.
We ourselves say that we, as the European Union, are reducing around 80% of these products.
That is why it is necessary and a good thing that we review the coherence of our development policy, our fisheries policy and our economic policy in relation to West Africa, as well as the extent to which it is positive or which extent to which its objectives are <unk>
Both products are about preventing the exploitation and achieving sustainable management.
Both products are concerned with ensuring the primacy of local economy and local supplies from international trade.
If we do not achieve this, any <unk> development will undermine the success of any development cooperation.
That is why this <unk> is so important so that we do not undermine and undermine the successes of our development policy by other policies that we do.
We know the instruments we can improve the situation.
We need better monitoring of fish and wood, and we need better monitoring of the activities of the <unk> and also of fisheries.
We need to set up an infrastructure, in the field of research and research and control and control of the <unk>
We have been aware of this for a long time, and we have been in that direction for some time now.
In this context, we must above all combat illegal fishing, illegal fishing and trade in illegal products.
We must do this on the ground in West Africa.
To this end, we must support the West African partner countries, including in the European Union, when it comes to market access.
We must strengthen our control systems.
It is a crucial task for development policy, <unk> and a sustainable, <unk> method in the event of <unk> and fishing.
Let me just mention one point and a conflict in relation to the report.
We have stated in this report that we need to improve the framework conditions for joint ventures between firms from the European Union and African partners that we need to create a <unk>
I think that is right and it is necessary, but we need to ensure that this does not lead to new overcapacity that our other measures, such as <unk> are <unk>
It is absolutely essential that we resolve this conflict.
That is why we have added a point to the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.
I would like to see the <unk> conflict behind the <unk> conflict which we have to add to what we must add to the content.
I think it is absolutely essential that we maintain that there is no new overcapacity here.
We must not remove this point from the report.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, on his report.
Policy Coherence for Development is an important point and let me assure you that reducing the negative impact and full exploitation of synergies between European policy and development is an integral part of our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
In addition to development policy, other policy areas can also make a significant contribution to development and, of course, to the effectiveness of our aid.
As you rightly pointed out in your report, deforestation is a cause for concern, and I believe that there is a cause for concern between two aspects: deforestation and climate change, the fight against illegal exploitation of forests.
In Bali the international community clearly recognised the destruction of forests as one of the main causes of climate change.
In the spirit of the UN Conference on Climate Change in 2008, the Commission intends to support the Forest Focus <unk> <unk> <unk> World Bank with EUR 5 million.
By 2010, additional EUR 60 million is earmarked for the financing of the Global Alliance against climate change, an initiative we have launched last year in order to help the poorest regions adapt to climate change.
Finally, several countries such as <unk> <unk> <unk> Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire have laid down measures for the management of natural resources and the management of this sector in their national programmes for the 10th European Development Fund.
West Africa is also an important partner of the Union in the fight against the illegal exploitation of forests, as well as <unk> <unk> Liberia and <unk> <unk> which export considerable quantities of money to Europe.
Two of these countries, Cameroon and <unk> are currently closing a voluntary association agreement with the Union, and Liberia will soon start with similar negotiations.
As far as fisheries policy is concerned, as you rightly pointed out, the new fisheries partnership agreements have led to greater coherence between the common fisheries policy and development policy, and these new agreements are no longer confined to opening fishing opportunities for Community vessels but also allowing dialogue with other partners to support them in the introduction of a truly sustainable and responsible fisheries policy in their waters.
The fisheries agreements <unk> not only provide a financial compensation, which often makes a significant contribution to income and thus to the macroeconomic stability of our partner countries, but also an important political and legal basis.
This allows the Community to develop its own fisheries policy on the basis of dialogue and in the light of the priorities in our partners' fisheries policy.
However, what I cannot agree with is the report that says that immigration and fisheries agreements are linked.
Even the countries concerned - for example Senegal in the person of Minister <unk> <unk> - have openly rejected the <unk> the presence of ships from the Community <unk> clearly on the resources and the decline in profitability for <unk> fishermen - those who are often most affected by illegal migration.
After all, we are working with fishermen, non-governmental organisations and private partners in Europe and in these countries, precisely in order to reduce as many negative imbalances as possible between our fishermen and vulnerable fishermen in these countries.
There is currently no European fleet that is competing with the <unk> vessels of these countries in West Africa, which cannot be said by other foreign industrial fleets.
First and foremost, I regret the unacceptable attitude of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which believes that not to have to comply with the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.
It has <unk> the procedure laid down in Article 47 of the enhanced cooperation procedure and the statements by the Committee on Fisheries on issues that are part of its competence.
He has also shown himself to be completely <unk> from the start of this report by trying to <unk> the competence of the Committee on Fisheries on the issue of fisheries partnership agreements.
While the Committee on Fisheries has given an opinion which deliberately respects the sensitivities that we know in the Committee on Development and the Committee on Development and the Committee on Development, as it is all well known from the outset, it has become bogged down in purely matters of the common fisheries policy.
Mr President, some of the committee chairmen have the tendency to believe that they do everything right and that the Rules of Procedure do not apply to them, although they should be their <unk>
The result is a confrontation between committees that damage the credibility of the entire institution.
I hope that this case will serve to stifle these attempts by the <unk> in the bud so that all those who share the role of fisheries partnership agreements in the development of villages and national fishing are able to do so on the basis of an analysis based on a comprehensive and comprehensive report.
By tabling this amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express our desire to return to the normal working method, although we have announced that we will call for the report to be referred back to the committee responsible, if the other groups do not support the amendment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for his very thorough and detailed report.
If our development policy is to be based on coherence, we need such detailed reports on issues relating to various aspects of development work.
It goes without saying that cooperation with other committees must be regulated, but when we talk about policy coherence we must clarify how the individual parliamentary committees should work together.
By analysing the exploitation of natural resources in West Africa, the European Union provides a realistic and not half-hearted assessment of its role in this region of Africa.
We should be aware that the use of natural resources has very specific and sometimes painful social consequences.
In this context, it is very worrying that fish stocks in West Africa are <unk> which can endanger local development, as these stocks are responsible for food security in the region.
It is true that African states are often not at all concerned about the sustainable use of natural resources.
We should therefore look at our activities in the region from both economic and ethical terms.
I realise that many politicians prefer to see European fishermen on the African west coast rather than on the streets of Brussels.
However, we must set ourselves in order not to indulge in hypocrisy because, without a sustainable fishing industry in West Africa, we cannot talk about a coherent development policy.
Nor should we try to export our social problems, because even if we could get them back to us, they could return to us.
In addition, I have the impression that we are also putting pressure on ourselves if we think that the withdrawal of our fleets from West Africa will come to our places of <unk> which will then operate with even lower standards than those currently in force.
This is a dangerous thinking and I do not think we should use such arguments.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, if we fish to the coast of Mauritania on the coast of Mauritania, the poorest of the poor are coming to Europe, because they do not see any future at home.
It is not the <unk> but our poorest areas that will have to cope with this.
Europe will then lose the support of its voters, especially at the lowest <unk>
Therefore, coherent policies are an absolute must.
In many respects, it is sad but also perfectly understandable that Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon.
For development policy, the Lisbon Treaty represents a real step forward.
In this document, coherence was established for the first time.
The Union must not take a hand with the poor countries with the other.
The EU's policy on agriculture, fisheries and trade should not <unk> development policy.
Of course, there are several <unk> but rivalry between Parliament's committees is not at stake.
That is <unk>
The Treaty of Nice merely said that the Union should present itself as a coherent force in the world.
This has proved inadequate.
In <unk> our agricultural policy allowed our agricultural policy to be offered export subsidies on the world market at dumping prices.
I am pleased that it is now more or less the past.
Only with the Treaty of Lisbon will the <unk> of poor countries provide a legal basis for ensuring solidarity with the poorest in the world.
Ireland voted against.
Above all, people with the lowest incomes said no, because the poorest of Europe cannot identify with this European Union as well.
Too much uncertainty, too many risks on their <unk> they must <unk> the consequences of this <unk> and <unk> policy.
So, as the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, has clearly pointed out, the task is to show solidarity with all citizens in Europe and in the developing countries while respecting the environment.
This is not an easy task.
There is a great temptation to show solidarity against the other <unk>
Nevertheless, there is no contradiction.
Solidarity with the developing countries is a prerequisite for real solidarity with the people of low incomes in Europe and in the rest of the world.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) When the countries of Europe exploit the natural resources of poorer countries, they leave a great deal to be desired.
Fish stocks in the West African countries are almost <unk> the illegal fishing industry is destroying the environment and exploiting other natural resources in the poor and politically unstable region.
Our action affects the indigenous population.
The report seeks to achieve greater cohesion between the <unk> and more influence for the European Parliament.
However, there are many special interests in this Parliament which are condemned to a European development aid policy.
International work in this area should be done by the United Nations and other organisations.
If we really want to change the world as we say, we need other measures.
Instead, the EU should review and reform its own policy.
The European Union must stop subsidising the failed European agricultural policy, ending hidden protectionism in trade policy and allowing its immoral fisheries agreements to be <unk>
(PL) Mr President, according to the resolutions adopted by the European Union, most Member States are concentrating their efforts on the African countries south of sub-Saharan Africa, including the countries of Africa.
Development aid is most needed in this region.
Poland also represents the European Union's position on development policy and supports the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in this region.
In Poland, public support for aid to developing countries is growing.
It was <unk> last year.
At the same time, we are aware that the individual Member States need to step up their efforts to fulfil their commitments and to strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of European development policy.
It is now a very important task for the European Union and Parliament to draw up a common position for the conferences in <unk> and Doha in view of the differences that exist here.
Africa has little experience of protecting its own biological resources as a region with most developing countries.
On the other hand, it is very important for Europe to access African raw materials and this policy is working with China and the Russian Federation.
It is vital for European partners that their economic attractiveness improves and that development aid is made less dependent on democratic reforms in Africa.
What is crucial for the countries of Africa is access to the EU energy market.
We should allow them access to them, even before Brazil, the United States or Australia.
That is why the aid programmes of the EU and the individual Member States must be better and more focused on coherence and cooperation.
As far as the use of natural resources in West Africa is concerned, we urgently need an effective system to assess the extent of the use, as well as better control of use.
I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for drawing attention to all the problems.
Mr President, according to the report, wood and fish are two of the most important resources.
As a <unk> of these products, it is therefore up to us to play an important role in their sustainable development.
The EU is currently considering granting Morocco a wider status which opens up better governance, a more intensive political dialogue and cooperation in foreign policy and security matters.
In principle, we are not opposed to this agreement on the condition that Morocco <unk> all violations of human rights in illegally occupied <unk> that Morocco will allow the population of Western Sahara, a free and fair referendum, that the Fisheries Partnership Agreement will be revised and that the <unk> population of Western Sahara will be allowed to live as the <unk> of equal citizens.
There are many reasons why Morocco is not qualified for a wider status.
In particular, the EU is going to strengthen the illegal occupation of Morocco and make the political process more difficult for a free and fair referendum.
Furthermore, the UN mission would be to organise a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara if the EU would grant Morocco this wider status.
Mr President, the discussion at this late hour clearly showed us all the importance of this issue, and I would therefore like to thank Parliament once again for the report.
As has rightly been pointed out, wood and fish are two main areas for economic and social development.
Let me emphasise once again that it is a priority for the EU and for the countries to remain a priority for the use of these natural resources in accordance with the development objectives.
As I explained at the beginning, the Commission is in favour of this objective, and the resolution that Parliament intends to adopt tomorrow will be an important contribution to our work.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to Mrs Fraga Estévez for his intervention, because we have worked very constructively on the report and have solved many problems.
We should separate this from the fact that there is an institutional conflict between the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
This is something that has to do with the fact that we have given a new job through the <unk> programme, namely the <unk>
The Council has decided that there should be a review of the coherence with development policy for 12 policies.
These policy areas will always fall within the remit of other committees.
Of course, there are always institutional conflicts.
That is a problem, but I would nevertheless like to express my thanks for the personal cooperation that has been achieved in this area.
Commissioner, I believe that the Commission has been on the right track since 2002 and also with the new <unk>
This is a good <unk> but I would like to encourage you to take this path radically towards the promotion of sustainable development.
Much remains to be done.
This right approach must be developed.
You certainly have the support of this Parliament.
A final word on the issue of the link between migration and <unk>
Of course, there is no conflict of interests here: migration has many causes.
But there are clear indications that there is also a link with overfishing.
And the European Union is also involved in overfishing - not only - but also the European Union.
The International Organisation for Migration has specifically demonstrated that for Senegal in particular.
In this respect, the President of Senegal is very badly aware of the reality of the reality in his own country and on his own coastlines.
We should take more critical approach and tackle this problem together and tackle this problem.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
(The sitting was closed at <unk> p.m.)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
The first item is the vote on the motion for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol on the conclusion of fishing opportunities and financial compensation following the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012 - <unk> -.
Mr Morillon has the floor to make a statement of the <unk>
(FR) Mr President, this motion is linked to the fact that we have had to renegotiate the practical conditions for the implementation of this partnership agreement with the Republic of Mauritania at the end of last year, and some here in this House will certainly remember Mr President, Mr <unk>
This renegotiation required close cooperation between the Commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid, Commissioner Louis Michel, and Commissioner Borg, and I welcome that.
It led to the establishment of a joint committee, which has come forward with an agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
Having said that, it is now a question of paying the amounts owed to the Republic of Mauritania from 1 August.
In agreement with all the political groups, we ask the Commission not to hold the vote on this report at this part-session but on the <unk>
This would allow our <unk> rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, to explain to us on Wednesday 25 June the exact conditions of this report so that we can vote on Thursday 26 June and make it possible to put it on the agenda of our next plenary session in July.
I believe that this would be a satisfactory solution for all three partners and, of course, for the Republic of Mauritania.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)

Common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying <unk> (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying <unk> - <unk> -.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) I am very pleased that we are here today to talk about the Return Directive, and it is practically the first of us - Parliament and the Council - on the issue of migration.
So we did not have any <unk> and I have to say that both the Council and Parliament and Mr Weber have made an extremely great effort to bring us to where we are today.
The vote in the Council has taken a very long time.
We needed more than two years to vote in favour of certain basic principles on which we were able to enter the political trialogue, and only before the end of last year we took the political trialogue that we had this year.
The approach that we have chosen to take, which I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Weber, saw that we had initially had an opinion of the majority of Member States and tried to harmonise texts and only then did we in the Council have a qualified majority for the text we are <unk>
The protection of certain points has been extremely difficult, or it has been difficult to achieve the very important issues that both Parliament and the Council of course regard as a matter of great importance for the time being, for which people who are illegally resident in the territory of the European Union must be imprisoned or whose freedom must be restricted.
It must be said very clearly that only in ten countries is a period of less than six months.
Only in ten of the 27 Member States are there less than six months, and all the other countries must adapt their legislation to the six months that we propose in this directive and which contains great advances in the options available to us and, of course, on the restriction of freedom.
It must also be mentioned that this is an extraordinary progress and a process of establishing standards that will be binding on all countries.
So far, each country has been subject to its own legislation, and of course I very much hope that we will be able to find an appropriate consensus here in Parliament today to conclude the first reading and to vote at first reading.
As a matter of fact, the issue was raised in our discussions.
Here in the Council, we have taken note of the arguments and views of Parliament, although the final negotiations on this issue are very difficult for the Council of Ministers to come to the Council of Ministers, and in the Council of Ministers we managed to convince ministers of the adoption of the regulations desired by Parliament, even though this means a significant increase in both the work and the financial resources that are <unk>
We must recognise the fact that the situation in relation to illegal immigration is very different - from the Mediterranean where there are major problems that are going to be exacerbated in the summer until countries that are far from migratory flows and can naturally react completely differently to migration.
I must say that I am of course pleased that we have found compromises that will help to improve the situation for migrants that we have placed the most vulnerable groups - families and children - and give them much more rights than is currently provided for in many national legislation, which I consider to be an extremely important step forward and an extremely important achievement of Parliament's negotiators during the debate on these issues.
But of course there are also some other things that need to be mentioned.
I have to say that the compromise in the Council has been reached with great difficulty.
The negotiations on which I myself have been involved in other ministers until the last day have proved extremely difficult and difficult and there is now the clear belief that this text is acceptable to the Council.
Any revision or change to the text will mean disagreement on the part of the Council and therefore of course the directive will be adopted at first reading.
What is the consequences of this?
There is no common standards, we do not improve the situation that we all want to improve and the process of adopting this directive is being delayed and made considerably longer.
It is very much more optimistic to assume that we will not be able to agree on a Return Directive in the next three years, and of course we will make the situation considerably worse for all those who could make a significant improvement.
However, these are not the only consequences in the case of the <unk> of this directive.
Another consequence is that other directives that we adopt in the codecision procedure and which could be a good example of the method of negotiation in this procedure could be a good example and could contribute significantly to improving work, in particular the directives on the <unk> and certain other rights of workers entering the European Union.
I think the path we are taking is right and we will be able to move forward.
Finally, I would like to thank both the rapporteur, Mr Weber and all the shadow rapporteurs who have always been present in all political negotiations for their constructive and fruitful cooperation, and of course the Vice-President and his staff from the Commission to find solutions to the many compromise solutions.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr <unk>
Let me begin by saying that this dossier is a real proof of the fact that the codecision procedure works, including in complex and difficult <unk>
The European Commission recommends an integrated approach to migration and this coherent approach requires consolidation of legal <unk> the integration of migrants on the ground and an efficient and generous <unk>
If we approve this rule of conditions for the entry of third-country nationals into the European Union, we must, of course, also establish rules that do not meet those conditions or no longer fulfil them.
Otherwise, our migration policy would lose its legitimacy.
We must admit that this could lead to a vicious circle.
If nothing is done against illegal immigration, we make the lives of those who are exploited by unscrupulous employers and we also make the integration of legal immigrants more difficult.
I therefore believe that we must break this vicious circle by the balance that Mr <unk> spoke about.
The directive incorporates the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights in Community law.
Its adoption will also enable us to use the Community control mechanisms to monitor compliance with the acquis.
Whether it is important to give priority to voluntary return to the rights of illegally displaced persons who are threatened by repatriation in order to safeguard the maintenance of these conditions, protection of family life, protection of family life in the framework of the directive and make it possible to combat the exploitation of children who are victims of illegal immigrants who are victims of illegal immigrants.
The directive obliges Member States either to adopt a <unk> or to grant a residence permit to a third-country nationals.
This approach means that legal certainty can be improved for all concerned.
The directive also has the advantage of providing the Commission with the opportunity to monitor its implementation, and I can assure you that the Commission and I, as the Commissioner responsible for this matter, will ensure respect for fundamental principles relating to the rights of migrants.
In particular, we will assess the impact of certain provisions on detention and legal assistance.
As Mr <unk> said, the directive will oblige all Member States to pay particular attention to children's rights.
In implementing these rules, the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child must be taken into account.
In particular, the Commission will monitor this in order to ensure that the special situation of the most vulnerable people is taken into account appropriately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank Mr Weber and the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the very important work of preparing a directive which I believe to be effective and which pays particular attention to human rights.
The Commission is seeking to introduce this coherent European framework for a visa policy which is effective and is subject to democratic control.
If I may, I would like to conclude by referring to the three statements that are part of the compromise which is part of the compromise that has been reached in the annex to the compromise amendment of your rapporteur, Mr Weber, as laid down in the compromise amendment.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the debate on this Return Directive is now behind us.
I would like to say thank you before the points of order are made.
We have had a complex issue, we have had a very serious issue that many people in Europe <unk> and we have had a new procedure, the codecision procedure.
That is why we had a large majority in favour of our ideas of a serious proposal.
We as a Parliament are <unk>
Thank you for the fair way in which we deal with each other, and thank the Slovenian Presidency of the Council, because it was the first presidency in the two and a half years to give a real impetus to the debate.
We are not talking about asylum, which is constantly being claimed.
The <unk> is another <unk>
We are talking about the people who are illegally resident in Europe today, millions of people who are illegally resident in Europe and which we want to <unk>
The <unk> which we have here today must end in the European Union.
This is about <unk> about a legal <unk> but that is also about a <unk>
I would like to address my speech today to those who are still sceptical in this House.
There are the accusations relating to the <unk> <unk> six months <unk>
Then there are countries which have 30 days of 40 days.
The European Council of Ministers of the Interior has committed itself to not taking the directive as a <unk> that is to say high standards.
Why does nobody see that we have nine Member States in the European Union who do not have a <unk>
We improve the situation in these countries.
Why does nobody see that we have written a separate chapter for children, for families and for families to establish minimum standards?
Especially for the <unk> children, who particularly need our help.
We have defined minimum standards.
Why does nobody have a duty to guarantee access to health care, to guarantee access to education for children?
Why does nobody see the essence of the <unk> that we want to keep them as short as possible, and that a person can only be arrested if a return is legally possible?
This means that the <unk> which is being applied today is prohibited in the European Union.
Why does nobody see that we have legal assistance that the NGOs have access to <unk>
Great progress is contained in this directive.
We have the <unk> <unk>
The European Parliament has enforced the principle of voluntary leave and what we do not have in all the countries today will therefore be a principle in the future.
The Council of Europe has expressed criticism and I have read it in the newspapers.
All the guidelines of the Council of Europe on return are now included in this directive, and so why will the Council of Europe criticise its own <unk>
We are achieving a great deal of progress, including the five-year period.
Please remember <unk> the Commission had proposed that a <unk> <unk> should be <unk>
We have managed to ensure that this commitment is now being removed.
We in the European Parliament have been able to achieve better regulation now.
Today, there will be a lot of criticism.
Many colleagues will be able to speak and describe how bad the <unk> are <unk> how bad the situation in these facilities is today, as inhumane in the European Union today.
We have been working hard for two and a half years and I am grateful for this exchange of views, but I am also quite clear today that anyone who votes against the directive against the directive makes sure that we in the European Union do not have any progress in improving these <unk>
I therefore ask that we be able to act.
In the light of the fact that the citizens in Ireland have rejected European development in the first place, we can in this dossier, in the first part of the codecision procedure, be <unk> we are capable of acting and we want a strong, humanitarian Europe!
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to begin my speech with a sincere congratulations to my colleague, Mr <unk>
This proposal for a directive is a solid and decisive step towards the common migration policy that we need.
The directive is an important instrument for protecting the fundamental rights of immigrants and a precondition for progress in the regulation of legal immigration.
The proposal lays down the voluntary return of immigrants residing illegally in the Member States as a priority and <unk> objective and provides them with the necessary resources so that their return is proportionate and without costs for them.
The alternative of <unk> is provided as a last resort and always under strict observance of fundamental rights.
Legal and linguistic assistance made available to immigrants and the possibility of appealing to the <unk> against a legal or legal background to this purpose are examples of how the proposal tries to give priority to the voluntary return of the <unk>
The setting of a maximum level of protection is an essential element of the directive.
It is difficult to understand how there can be places in the European Union today where immigrants can be detained indefinitely, but no Member State can use the directive to tighten up its laws in the field of migration, especially in relation to the issue of <unk>
There is also a clear distinction between repatriation and asylum.
Clear legal guarantees are laid down regarding the arrest warrant.
The new Article 15 lays down more and better conditions for minors and their families, and, finally, the directive allows the Court of Justice to grant competence in this area.
For all these reasons, Mr President, and with due respect for the efforts of the rapporteur, the Council and the Commission, I would ask for support for the <unk>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, today we are discussing one aspect of the introduction of a European immigration policy, and we can already make a point of stating that we are building a Europe that is in itself <unk> even though we are to try to combat illegal immigration, which will allow the legal entry of migrants.
My group rejects the compromise that the Presidency and the rapporteur, <unk> have achieved, not because we are against the European return policy, but because we believe that the result is completely inadequate in terms of protecting fundamental rights.
We have always said that we are in favour of a <unk> because we have observed too many terrible things during our visits to <unk>
However, we do not want a directive at any price.
I have heard that this directive would allow people to escape from illegal immigration.
This is a major <unk> because the directive only lays down provisions for the organisation of repatriation and allows it to be granted a right of residence.
The rapporteur considers this compromise balanced because it grants a number of rights.
These rights, such as access to education for minors or access to <unk> are not really binding.
Furthermore, the directive does not bring about improvements in prison in the European Union.
Reducing the minimum period to 18 months seems to be an improvement in nine of the 27 Member States.
Of these nine Member States, however, three - the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark - are not affected because they do not take part in the implementation of this directive.
There will be some improvements in countries such as Malta where most of the people who are in prison are asylum seekers who are not covered by the directive.
The prisoners in Greece are essentially people who have been subjected to the illegal crossing of an external border.
These people are not covered by the scope of this directive.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has therefore tabled a limited number of amendments aimed at achieving a human dimension of this text.
This is the first codecision procedure of the European Parliament in the field of combating illegal immigration, so we, as Members of the European Parliament, have a duty to advocate clear legislation which is not subject to different interpretations by the Member States or the arbitrary nature of the Court.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to use all the means at its disposal to allow the adoption of legislation that improves the fate of the prisoners.
That is our duty as a European Parliament.
But does this not exempt us from a <unk> rather philosophical question <unk> the earth all the people?
Should some of these people really be condemned to live in poverty?
Do you not believe that this is the real problem?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, negotiations with the Council were <unk> tough, complicated and tough.
For most of the Member States, the first question was this: 'How do you envisage such a directive if you were to have any common European standards for returning illegally staying <unk>
The Council and Parliament were quite clear about how a suitable directive should be equipped with the relevant <unk>
Parliament had to argue for every single word and <unk>
Every one of you, and especially the PSE Group, should now be absolutely clear that the compromise package contains rules where there is still nothing to date.
The Member States that have already introduced more favourable provisions should adhere to or introduce them if necessary.
The national parliaments have the task of ensuring this in the implementation of the directive.
We also agreed a political statement from the Council that this directive should not be used as a pretext for reducing existing standards and should be allowed to lower existing standards.
In line with the experience of ten other asylum and asylum systems, it is not to be feared that Member States tend to exploit the implementation of such directives as an appropriate opportunity to exploit their national jurisdiction.
At the moment, there is no European legislation on returning illegally staying <unk>
With the adoption of the package, we will have Community control mechanisms.
<unk> competence of the European Court of Justice, reporting by the European Parliament and the European Parliament will be available to us.
After three years of debate, there is no room for manoeuvre and it is obvious that the second reading will not make any improvements.
That is what I have to admit, but it is true.
The Council will put forward a list of many <unk> proposals.
The Pandora's box is now open.
It is clear that the political climate in most Member States is not currently helpful.
So how do we introduce common minimum standards where no rules are <unk>
How can we ensure that Community control mechanisms are available.
How do we ensure that the Council of Europe directives are legally binding for all Member States?
At the moment, the fundamental question is this: do we want a directive or not?
Do we want a directive that is not perfect, but certainly a first step in the right <unk> Or do we not want any directive at all, because we are satisfied with the situation, as it is <unk>
Even now, many Member States would be relieved if the efforts for a directive fail because Parliament does not create it.
What ironic that the <unk> who want to <unk> the compromise package actually support those Member States that do not want European minimum guarantees for <unk>
In the compromise package, we should look at a very important but important first step.
<unk> is not an isolated matter, but a necessary part of a package of measures on migration, which also includes legal immigration and asylum.
I think it is really time for us to have our responsibilities after three years of debate and negotiation.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his sincere and open handling of these issues.
I would also like to thank my fellow Members, because we have made every effort to find a common approach because we have recognised the need to treat people in the <unk> like people and need proper procedures and legal clarity.
The discussions with the Council clearly reveal the shortcomings that exist in some Member States at the moment in dealing with their own citizens, and this applies particularly to the issue of <unk> - a necessary condition for enabling those concerned to access legislation and the right to defence against all those who have power - and to cases where there is no effective system for protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and young people.
There were some problems in the discussions in the Council.
I regret that, after all these negotiations, my group cannot accept the proposal and, although we do not reject this directive, it has not fulfilled certain standards that we have set out from the outset.
Why not?
Because we believe that there are still many problems that we are fighting against in our own Member States.
One of these problems is the length of the <unk>
Even though the proposed directive provides for ceilings here, we know how a long period of <unk> can affect the mental health of those affected and children.
We have seen it with our own eyes and it is scientifically documented.
We have seen the conditions with our own eyes and many people live in detention and it is clear from the directive that <unk> cannot be prisons but we see no difference between these institutions and prisons.
In addition, we have questions about Article 9 of Article 9 of the Rules of Procedure, which clearly stipulate that this is in principle the case for everyone who has made a <unk>
Consequently, the Member States must also respond to such issues from my own constituency of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have refugee status in respect of their <unk> in the eighth month of the year, whose husband has been forcibly sent to Iraq and which is now missing.
Under this directive, the ban on travel would also apply to him.
So, despite all the manifestations of the protection of human dignity, the protection of <unk>
Article 3, paragraph <unk> also raises the question of where people are being deported and we believe that, if the recent <unk> <unk> <unk> is also covered by the recent <unk> <unk> between Mr Berlusconi and Gaddafi it is not acceptable because such agreements are not taken within the framework of written public agreements.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the problem under discussion today has been largely caused by the EU Member States themselves.
When we look at the speeches of the representatives of the representatives of the political parties here, it is clear that these circles have called for a law to liberalise the visa regime for third-country nationals.
Today, in this House, there are many calls for legal regulations aimed at the traditional family or Christian traditions of Europe.
We have to wait for a few years before we hear mass calls and resolutions in which we are asked to save the identity of our continent, because what Europe has once again made an example for the whole world.
The proposal in the motion to create new <unk> is not <unk>
These tasks should be implemented within the framework of the existing institutions which have already been extended.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a disgrace and an insult to European <unk>
It is totally unacceptable and will be welcomed by the welcome culture that we have maintained for thousands of years and the deep roots of a European identity, which has been <unk> by this hospitality <unk>
The directive is a further contribution to fortress Europe, the <unk> of a reactionary <unk> who wants to put an end to the freedom of movement of men and women.
The right to mobility cannot be restricted by <unk> men and women behind <unk> or in a <unk> <unk>
Mr <unk> we are talking about 18 months, the maximum <unk> not six months, as you said.
A <unk> prison without guilty <unk>
I would like to refer to the words of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Italian <unk> who said that a person could not be kept in prison because of a purely administrative <unk> and people should not be detained in inhuman and <unk> <unk> such as those that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has visited in.
Furthermore, this directive is an inhuman directive because it provides for repatriation to a transit country.
Libya will probably be a target for <unk> migrants.
The directive lays down the imprisonment and deportation of unaccompanied minors and is so systematically opposed to the right to asylum and provides for any other <unk>
That is the real nature of this directive.
Moreover, the directive is forced by governments.
In this Chamber, we have witnessed a dictatorship of the Council that has said to Parliament that it <unk> it or you <unk> it and you have even responded with threats to the idea of continuing the <unk>
The European Parliament is making this decision <unk>
I appeal to the dignity of the European Parliament.
This is not a codecision.
What we see here is the approval of the Council.
The truth is that the governments want to activate EUR 700 million from the EU budget.
That is the real reason for this directive.
We should listen to society, those people outside this House, the Heads of State of third countries, Amnesty International, the churches, the European <unk> the unions and the <unk> you all advise us not to adopt this directive.
Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees who, according to the Treaty of Amsterdam in all the asylum and asylum systems with which the European Commission is involved, is to be consulted on the issue of not adopting this directive.
<unk> policies such as these are the real cause of the EU's biggest tragedy and deaths at sea.
Yesterday 150 people died and there were 12 000 in the last ten years.
The European Union <unk> itself with an unacceptable crime and this directive continues to be complicit in the <unk> which turned the Mediterranean into a <unk>
It would probably be a good idea not to adopt this directive as a tribute to these <unk>
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) When all the doors are closed, one can still find a way through the back door.
Every year, thousands of people are trying to reach the EU which is increasingly building walls along their borders.
These attempts are always being made and the media regularly report how many of these people are paying their lives.
In today's debate we are talking about those who have managed to <unk> but we are now trying to <unk>
Many human rights organisations criticise the proposed directive, including <unk> and Amnesty International.
We must listen to these warnings because the proposal for a directive violates human rights.
If we jointly decide that people who have nothing to <unk> up to 18 months, then there will be no European added value.
A longer period of time does not result in more people.
It is simply an inhumane and expensive solution to a complex problem.
<unk> into the EU of up to five years will result in an increase in illegal immigration.
<unk> people will be forced to turn to traffickers and we will read more and more of refugees in need, which will lead to hatred towards our part of the Western world.
The human rights organisations have warned us.
Now we must act and make a strong commitment to defending human rights at national level.
(NL) Mr President, how serious it is about the total absence of a <unk> approach to the scourge of millions of illegal immigrants in Europe is evident from the <unk> reactions of the politically correct left-wing <unk> to this Return Directive.
I am sorry, but a Return Directive is not.
It even obliges Member States to grant free legal advice free legal advice so that they can be <unk>
At the same time, at least seven Member States need to shorten the duration of the <unk> period.
In addition, the directive basically provides two possibilities for the same level of expulsion - expulsion or regularisation - as if it were a neutral option, even though it is a neutral option, even though the massive <unk> which several Member States have <unk> in recent years, a strong <unk> and also a strong <unk>
To sum up, I wish that this would be a genuine <unk> which would once again be <unk> the <unk> for illegal immigrants, but that is unfortunately not the case.
I am not convinced that this is a first small step in the right direction.
- (MT) I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Weber, on his very useful cooperation in drawing up this legislation and of this compromise that we have been able to achieve.
Mr President, as the result of the referendum last week in Ireland shows, people believe that the European Union does not take sufficient account of its concerns - and if we look at the current surveys - that immigration is one of the greatest concerns of the citizens of the EU, the citizens of the EU want more of Europe, not less, but the answer we have given to them is far from good enough.
That is why the European Union will not take the issue of immigration seriously, unless it shows that it is able to provide a clear and effective response to this.
What is the starting point for this directive?
The starting point is that it applies to everyone who is illegal.
If someone is illegally <unk> the answer can only be that he has to drop where he is <unk>
That is the purpose of this <unk> and anyone who is voting against it says and makes clear to others that illegality can remain and that we can accept them.
This is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.
For those whom we have to <unk> in this compromise, there are a number of conditions that vary according to the arrests, treatment, application of health services and other factors.
It is not perfect, but it is a good compromise that we are <unk>
We want to show that we are able to respond to this compromise.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to address the Council, because we are not debating our directive or the Commission proposal, but about the way in which the Council has given it any meaning.
This directive reflects the common direction that has taken place in Europe.
The fact that the Council has adopted it unanimously does not reduce the message that it sends it, but strengthens it.
It is a message that we are talking about from a Europe based on suspicion.
It is not about the appropriateness of a directive that creates a common system.
The question is what this directive requires.
On the day after the death of 150 illegal immigrants in the Mediterranean, you would ask us to tell the survivors that, from tomorrow, those who, as they are already in our countries, are faced with a provision that is to be held up to 18 months.
We are adopting a devastating <unk> which provides the opportunity to deprive a person of an administrative measure for up to 18 months of his freedom without committing a crime.
What we would never tolerate in our countries would be <unk> this for a European citizen, allow and support illegal <unk>
The 18 amendments tabled by our group, which are politically <unk> are an attempt to restore a provision which is a disgrace not only for the European Union but also for our Member States in terms of legal dignity.
If it is not adopted, there will be many votes against the directive, including <unk> Mr President.
